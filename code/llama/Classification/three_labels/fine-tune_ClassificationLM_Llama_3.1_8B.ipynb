    "### Big Picture Overview of Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning Methods like LoRA and QLoRA Fine Tuning for Sequence Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Essence of Fine-tuning**\n",
    "- LLMs are pre-trained on vast amounts of data for broad language understanding.\n",
    "- Fine-tuning is crucial for specializing in specific domains or tasks, involving adjustments with smaller, relevant datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Fine-tuning with PEFT: Exploring LoRA and QLoRA**\n",
    "- Traditional fine-tuning is resource-intensive; PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning) makes the process faster and less demanding.\n",
    "- Focus on two PEFT methods: LoRA and QLoRA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Power of PEFT**\n",
    "- PEFT modifies only a subset of the LLM's parameters, enhancing speed and reducing memory demands, making it suitable for less powerful devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LoRA: Efficiency through Adapters**\n",
    "- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):** Injects small trainable adapters into the pre-trained model.\n",
    "- **Equation:** For a weight matrix $W$, LoRA approximates $W = W_0 + BA$, where $W_0$ is the original weight matrix, and $BA$ represents the low-rank modification through trainable matrices $B$ and $A$.\n",
    "- Adapters learn task nuances while keeping the majority of the LLM unchanged, minimizing overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QLoRA: Compression and Speed**\n",
    "- **Quantized LoRA (QLoRA):** Extends LoRA by quantizing the modelâ€™s weights, further reducing size and enhancing speed.\n",
    "- **Innovations in QLoRA:**\n",
    "  1. **4-bit Quantization:** Uses a 4-bit data type, NormalFloat (NF4), for optimal weight quantization, drastically reducing memory usage.\n",
    "  2. **Low-Rank Adapters:** Fine-tuned with 16-bit precision to effectively capture task-specific nuances.\n",
    "  3. **Double Quantization:** Reduces quantization constants from 32-bit to 8-bit, saving additional memory without accuracy loss.\n",
    "  4. **Paged Optimizers:** Manages memory efficiently during training, optimizing for large tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why PEFT Matters**\n",
    "- **Rapid Learning:** Speeds up model adaptation.\n",
    "- **Smaller Footprint:** Eases deployment with reduced model size.\n",
    "- **Edge-Friendly:** Fits better on devices with limited resources, enhancing accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "- PEFT methods like LoRA and QLoRA revolutionize LLM fine-tuning by focusing on efficiency, facilitating faster adaptability, smaller models, and broader device compatibility.\n",

    "### Fine-tuning for Sentiment Analysis Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Text Generation with Sentiment Label as part of text\n",
    "- **Approach**: Train the model to generate text that naturally appends the sentiment label at the end.\n",
    "- **Input**: \"TSLA slashes model Y prices ======\"\n",
    "- **Output**: \"TSLA slashes model Y prices ====== Bearish\"\n",
    "- **Use Case**: This method is useful for applications requiring continuous text output that includes embedded sentiment analysis, such as interactive chatbots or automated content creation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Sequence Classification Head\n",
    "- **Approach**: Add a sequence classification head (linear layer) on top of the LLaMa Model transformer. This setup is similar to GPT-2 and focuses on classifying the sentiment based on the last relevant token in the sequence.\n",
    "    - **Token Positioning**:\n",
    "        - **With pad_token_id**: The model identifies and ignores padding tokens, using the last non-padding token for classification.\n",
    "        - **Without pad_token_id**: It defaults to the last token in each sequence.\n",
    "        - **inputs_embeds**: If embeddings are directly passed (without input_ids), the model cannot identify padding tokens and takes the last embedding in each sequence as the input for classification.\n",
    "- **Input**: Specific sentences (e.g., \"TSLA slashes Model Y prices\").\n",
    "- **Output**: Direct sentiment classification (e.g., \"Bearish\").\n",
    "- **Training Objective**: Minimize cross-entropy loss between the predicted and the actual sentiment labels.\n",
