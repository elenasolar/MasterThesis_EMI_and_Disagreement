Glad I stopped wearing one a long time ago; Reply: I think you guys are misunderstanding the data. It doesn't mean 0.5-2 overall, it means 0.5-2 per day which also means compounding. Assuming the death rate was, say, 10,000 per day when this study started, decreasing the death rate by 0.5-2 per day would leave you with, at the high end, about 5500 deaths per day after the 100 day study. I'd consider that a pretty drastic change.",1,0.9824,disagree

The filibuster is a hold over from Jim Crow. Super majorities were debated by the founders during the constitutional debates and rejected. Republicans have weaponized a Senate rule to change the power structure and negate the results of elections and the will of the people. Worrying about what Republicans MIGHT do in future is no excuse to continue to allow them to abuse a Senate rule and preemptively kill Amy bill they don't like while not actually holding a majority.; Reply: You're wrong on this, friend. Joe Manchin, bless him, will hold the line and maintain the Filibuster for the sake of preserving what American democracy is. Without the Filibuster, our laws will change drastically each time power changes hands. Repealing the Filibuster is short-sighted and non-productive in the grand scheme. Thankfully, it won't ever actually get abolished, so there's nothing to worry about. But hearing people discuss it is cringe-worthy.",1,0.991,disagree

You want us to run general election ads in may of a non-election year?,Yep. I want Democrats to control the narrative and the best way to do that is to establish it earliest.

We need to get the bill creating an investigation passed ASAP.
