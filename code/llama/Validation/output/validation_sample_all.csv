It seems like they just want the same sex couples to be married in order to give them a visa Weird... I thought the trump administration didn't want gay people getting married... but then I was wondering Does the US grant Visas for the boyfriends or girlfriends of diplomats in heterosexual relationships? Because if the answer is no, then at least it's just a stupid policy, and not a stupid policy that discriminates against the LGBT community."," Does the US grant Visas for the boyfriends or girlfriends of diplomats in heterosexual relationships? No, because diplomats in a serious heterosexual relationship can get married, and then their partner will have access to the visa. Diplomats from most countries in a serious homosexual relationship can't get married, and so can never apply for the Visa.  Weird... I thought the trump administration didn't want gay people getting married... The old policy encouraged homosexual diplomats. The new policy discourages homosexual diplomats. There is absolutely nothing in the policy that encourages homosexuals to get married. andx200B","Well, except if they get married in the US, the problem goes away because the marriage would have to be recognized by the US government and the G-4 Spousal visa would be granted per every article Ive read on it so far.

Just to be clear though, are you confirming that heterosexual boyfriends or girlfriends cannot get visas to the US just because their boyfriendgirlfriend is a Diplomat? That was my main question.

Unfortunately, there are some people who lose out on trade but we have institutions in place to help those people called TAA or Trade Adjustment Assistance. Trade deals are a net positive for the U.S. consumer especially low-income families because they are affected the most by the drop in prices. And the benefit from trade deals is more wide-ranging then simply lower prices for consumers, We also see the advantage of having low-income high labor jobs being replaced by more higher paying work in factories. We also see increased capital investment from outside sources. Normally, this happens because people want to have a stake in their own investment in the U.S. The reason populists like Bernie and Trump bash trade deals is because they are an easy target... Plain and simple. It's easy to point to something most people don't understand and say Hey! this is bad! Because its Shadowy and no one understands it! The basic pros of trade deals are 1. Lower Prices for consumers Which helps poor people the most 2. Allows for more foreign investment In which most cases leads to more jobs 3. Allows for us to have higher paying jobs and to use our capital to better efficiency.

The only thing i've heard of is the cover up of the Benghazi attacks in '12. Anything else in foreign affairs? What about domestic?","It surprises the hell out of me, how many people actually do call for this. It's still just the really hardcore conservatives that want it, but there is some merit in the accusations. Impeachment isn't possible, though, with the makeup of the Congress as it is, and it would be the biggest political mistake of the century if it were tried. I'll try to do a simple rundown, starting with foreign affairs  Benghazi is a big one. This event has become highly politicized, but the fact remains that a United States Ambassador was killed inside of a United States Consulate, and no one was held responsible or accountable. And it seems that there could have been an attempt to brush this attack off as a protest, but I'm not sure that conclusion can be made conclusively. However, even if this claim were true, it is not an impeachable defense unless the President himself can be proven to have given a direct order. Otherwise, the blame would go to whoever changed those talking points--depending on motives.  Drone targeting programs. The President has directly ordered drone strikes all over the Middle East. One of these was actually made to target an American citizen, named Anwar al-Awlaki Those attacks have also unintentionally killed 3 other American citizens, who were killed because of their close proximity to an intended target. One of these was al-Awlaki's 16 year old son who was killed in Yemen in 2011. This ordered killing of American citizens for a crime is done without trial, and they are denied Constitutional rights of trial and facing their accusor. The crimes they committed were terrible, but they are American citizens and still have the same rights we all do. There is another American citizen on the target list, still. This is, possibly, an impeachable offense. There are a few domestic issues as well. There have been quite a few executive actions taken that seem to overstep the President's Constitutional authority  He drew up new deportation guidelines that allowed more illegal immigrants to avoid deportation. This could be impeachable if the President was found to be failing to enforce the Law as passed by Congress.  He has taken several actions on gay marriage that may have been outside his authority. The DOJ advised state Attorneys General to ignore some state laws defining marriage, because the President had deemed DOMA unconstitutional I don't care where you stand politically, the President doesn't have that authority. This could be impeachable, depending on specific orders given.  Delaying the ACA was a pretty big deal. The Congress passed specific deadlines for implementation, and the President changed those. That is a pretty clear violation of the intelligible principle which is supposed to guide executive action. Not to mention the shitty conditions it puts businesses in, when they literally have no idea now whether a deadline for some sort of compliance is going to be firm or not.  That whole IRS deal This issue has be come so fucking politicized it's almost impossible to tell what actually happened. But if it is true that officials at IRS were directed to act with prejudice against organizations based on their political leanings, then that is a pretty serious crime. If the President directly gave the order, it's definitely impeachable. I should probably make it clear that I'm not saying the President should be impeached because of any or all of these things, but these are some of the reasons that people are claiming. It's all politics, but every impeachment always is. EDIT Changed Embassy to Consulate after a few complaints."," It's still just the really hardcore conservatives that want it actually, its pretty much everyone who still believes in the constitution, and isnt blinded by the media's portrayal of the issues. i'm not a conservative, by any measure. my political beliefs more closely align with the democratic party than any other, and though what i am about to say may stem somewhat from my feelings of betrayal at obama's broken election promises, i DO think there is genuine reason for obama to be impeached. he has repeatedly, intentionally violated the constitution in pursuit of greater national security. the drone targeting programs are profoundly unconstitutional. EVERYONE deserves a trial, no matter how evil they may seem. al-awalaki didnt have his finger on a detonator, he wasnt even in the US, he WAS NOT an imminent threat. the right to a trial is the most fundamental right there is. if the government takes that away then they are no better than the terrorists. it is disrespectful to those who died in the war for independence, to even consider taking away our constitutional rights in pursuit of a little more security. obama was elected on promises of restoring the constitution, and eliminating the patriot act, and yet after 6 years in office, the patriot act is stronger than ever. universal healthcare should be the right of every american, but obamacare is a fucking joke. at this point he would be better off just copying the canadian or australian system, because those systems WORK.",Ask_Politics
k6p7jf,gemrxp1,genjmqk,How does a stimulus bill impact the value of the US dollar and if the value of the dollar decreases because of this - does that mean a stimulus is a bad idea? Anything we can do to mitigate this while still helping people struggling because of COVID fallout?,"This is actually one of my favorite things to talk about not COVID, the US dollar. As another user pointed out, the answer kind of depends on what you mean by weakenbecause you specifically mention the value of the dollar decreasing I assume youre talking about inflation where the prices of goods and services increase over time, thus decreasing the purchasing power of a dollar. 1. Inflation, or the decreasing value of a unit of currency, can actually be a sign of a healthy economy. Economists have different opinions about what, exactly, is the ideal rate of inflation. Most believe an annual inflation rate of 1-3 is reasonable, and while they dont have an official inflation target, the US Federal Reserves unofficial target number is a 2 inflation rate. The reason why is because inflation indicates that people are making and spending money when people spend money, demand in general is increasing and thus prices increase because more people are buying more things. Nowinflation can be unhealthy for an economysee Argentina, with an inflation rate of 35-60 in the past several years. Inflation rates above 4 for a sustained period are indicative of a problem with the stability of both the currency and the economy as a whole. The US is not at risk for currency instability in the same way countries like Argentina are experiencing. Ill explain more about that down below. 2. Deflation an increase of the purchasing power of a unit of currency, on the other hand, is almost always a bad sign for an economy. Two notable times the US economy experienced deflation, or an increasing value of the dollar, were during the Great Depression in the 30s and the Great Recession in the 2000s. You definitely dont want deflation. Many economists are warning that the US dollar is actually at risk of experiencing deflation, and thats not surprising millions of Americans still dont have jobs and thus arent making and subsequently spending as much, many are choosing to stay home for safety, and many businesses are closed or have reduced hours and are making less money. Though the US dollar isnt currently experiencing deflation, its closer than many economists and advisers are comfortable with the current rate is 1.18 which is a decent amount below the usual target. 3. Now, some things of note inflation and deflation arent CAUSES of economic events, theyre OUTCOMES. For instance people dont spend money because inflation is high, inflation is high because consumers are spending more than the previous year. The reverse is true of deflation. So inflation rate is one of a handful of ECONOMIC INDICATORS that give us a general idea of how the economy is doing overall. 4. But lets talk about the US dollar specifically. The US dollar is whats called a fiat currency its not tied to any particular physical resource ie gold, silver. I could write a book about why the USD not being pegged to any sort of resource-based standard is a good thing, but thats not the point of this comment. All you need to know is, that makes it easier for Federal Reserve policy to influence the dollar. There are a lot of reasons why the US dollar is unlikely to experience any period of dramatic instability. The US economy is somewhat stable, there are many industries that are operating as efficiently as they were last year or better IE logistics, broadbandtelecom, and many of the industries that are taking a huge hit IE service and retail havent collapsed because of economic reasons, COVID is an outside factor thats causing the problem and once its solved many industries will eventually resume normal functionality though it still might take a couple years to recover. Which leads us to 5. How is the dollar impacted by federal economic policy. There are many ways the federal government can influence inflation and the overall economy. Another commenter mentioned the 1T infusion of cash into the stock market that happened this summer. This, and similar strategies referred to as quantitative easing, are best used when the economy is experiencing trouble at the industry level if a certain kind of industry is doing bad and its threatening to disrupt the economy, the Federal Reserve may temporarily purchase a large number of stocks andor bonds to artificially stabilize the market. This is usually best utilized as a last resort measure in response to an extreme and rapid decline in stock prices. Thats part of the problem. The other problem in the US is that consumers have way less purchasing power. Many people have lost jobs, are working fewer hours, or are just flat-out earning less. The one and only solution to this is a DIRECT STIMULUS which is whats being discussed in congress right now. Thats what youre asking about now, too. A direct stimulus is the best and most efficient way to infuse cash into a stagnant economy when unemployment is high. 6. FINALLY, THE ANSWER short answer, no-a decreasing value of the dollar is not a bad thing. The US economy is experiencing a period of lower inflation. This means the economy is not growing at a fast enough rate. The reason why is because people arent spending money. People are spending less in 2020 vs last year because theyre MAKING lesscant spend money you dont have. A direct stimulus gives people money to spend, which helps stabilize the US economy and keep it afloat. And in this instance, like another commenter mentioned, the direct stimulus is actually a tax advance. The government isnt just printing money to give to us, its redistributing money that already exists to the place where its most likely to go back into the economy directly into consumers pockets. So if youre worried a stimulus is going to cause inflationthats actually the point. A small amount of inflation is a good thing!","Thank you, mother of the Batman!

But the more that I look at the election processes for Canada, the more that I feel it is flawed by design. I'm hoping that someone on Reddit with a better understanding of politics can reassure me or confirm my worries. The first issue that I notice with elections is ridings. It just seems odd to me how, theoretically, a majority government could possibly be elected with minimal support so long as half of the ridings are supportive of the government, even if the majority of voters decided to vote for another party. It often seems like your vote doesn't matter if the riding you are in tends to vote for another party. This apparent loophole has been bugging me and an explanation as to the merits of such a system would be appreciated. The second issue that troubles me is the idea that a non-vote is useless. It is often said a non-voter has no right to complain, but this statement annoys me as I can think of numerous reasons as to why someone will not vote. As it currently stands I am lumped into this group, as I have not had a chance to vote yet. This issue seems to me to be linked to my first issue. I would like to know if a non-vote truly is useless or is there a value to saying none of the representatives represent me? My third issue stems from multiple representatives representing me. As I am currently aware there is no way for me to vote so as to be properly represented. I can't vote 34 for party A and 14 for party B seeing how both parties have aspects that I like. I am aware that they attempted to address this in the last provincial election for BC but from what I have heard, it was a mess. Is this something that is wrong with democracy and should be addressed? Lastly it doesn't seem right that after the ballot has been passed that I cannot change my vote if the elected leader is better or worse then expected. It seems to me that democracy only comes once every four' years for one day. I would like to know if is feasible to ask for the ability to change my vote for whom represents me whenever I wish?

To someone who is against the contraception mandate of the ACA which I am not, by the way, there is no right to contraception in the first place. To someone who is against gay marriage which I am not, by the way, there is no right to marry. Heterosexual marriage, they might argue, is something the state has an interest in facilitating and encouraging because they believe it's so crucially important to the social order and very fabric of civilized society. Given the premises that conservatives believe about issues like this e.g. that a fetus is a person, their actions which you perceive to be antithetical to small government are actually entirely consistent with the responsibilities of even the smallest government. You can certainly argue that a given premise is incorrect, but you can't assess the consistency of conservatives' actions using only premises you believe to be true. It'd be like if conservatives accused liberals of contradicting liberal notions of tolerance, acceptance, and anti-discrimination based on liberals' tendency to want to prohibit people from carrying firearms in public spaces. Conservatives would argue that it's discrimination and prejudice against gun owners based on nothing but statistically-derived fears not unlike the statistically-derived fears of prejudging a black person as dangerous. It's a silly claim to make because liberals have a different conception of the rights value inherent to the possession of firearms than do conservatives. It's possible that liberals are wrong to take the position they do, but it's not inconsistent given the premises that liberals hold about guns.","The issue with this argument from my perspective is that you are equating things that are involuntary ex being black, or gay or a woman with something that is voluntary gun ownership.",Ask_Politics

It also promotes coyotes and smugglers and puts children who are brought along in danger. I also think that heavy unfettered migration might put a citizen out of a job, or make finding one harder.

t1gify,hyhdwg0,hyohzfq,"Are there any authors or works that explore a defense of a more conservative liberalism that does not rely on natural rights as Locke did or advance an abstract societal blueprint as Rawls did, such as the utilitarian approach of J. S. Mill non-natural rights derived from the harmutility principles and institutionspolicies sensitive to concrete circumstances, while at the same time explicitly stressing a precautionary skepticism regarding the use of abstract reasoning or rationalism in politics to avoid the dangerous radicalisms that such systems promote if not applied conservatively as seen in Burke's brand of traditionalism? While it doesn't need to be specifically a utilitarian approach, that seems to be the most common alternative to a defense of liberalism. Coleridge's romanticism influenced Mill's utilitarian liberalism to theoretically be more historically sensitive than Bentham's, but in practice he continued to advocate for similarly profound and radical institutional changes. Sidgwick seems to be the only major utilitarian in the conservative tradition, but I can't find much on his political views aside from economics, not to mention contradicting sources pointing towards him not being so conservative after all. Liberalism is the dominant political philosophy in the western world, but there seems to be a surprising lack of diversity of non-natural rights-based approaches, in particular a branch of such a liberalism that avoids radical institutional changes in favor of more gradual reform, as I expected utilitarian empiricists also associated with skepticism to gravitate towards. If this is an unreasonably specific request, I would appreciate recommendations of more material that addresses individual elements of what I have mentioned, even if it doesn't include all of them. Note For clarity, I started this search when reading SEP's article on Conservatism, which claimed Sidgwick to use somewhat Millian-Liberal principles to arrive at somewhat Burkean-conservative conclusions which striked me as a surprisingly harmoneous synthesis, in theory.","In a political theory class we spent a whole day on the justification of rights. The third one we came up with which I suggested was that people having rights was beneficial for the economy, for happiness and for maintaining order.

What level of donation and support does it take to make the list?

This is not the case for the majority of appointees, particularly Schedule C appointees which are policy-oriented positions that require specialized knowledge or expertise. The political appointees you generally hear about being linked to donating or bundling for a candidate are low-risk ambassadorships the vast majority of which 70 are still career foreign service personnel. Most appointees are, even if tangentially connected to the campaign, brought in more from a who you know process -- not a how much you gave. For example, about half the appointees I know were brought in because they went to college with the son of someone who worked in the administration or something similar. Remember that there are thousands of positions that need to be filled the president isn't going to sit down and comb a list of his donors and offer those people jobs. He quite frankly wouldn't have time to do that, and neither would most of his senior staff. What that means is that friends of friends, cousins, and qualified individuals who either manage to be seen or have an even looser connection to the incoming administration are hired. Established names, i.e. experts in their fields, are also common picks. Certain think tanks in DC, for example, will be tapped and fellows brought over to the White House. Obama was fond of the Center for American Progress, for example. You're more likely to be brought into the administration as an appointee if you have worked for the campaign directly than if you were a donor for a campaign. Indeed, many chiefs of staff bristle at the thought of hiring people based on donor history or being a family member to one. In the majority of cases they'd like to hire competent people, and that often means hiring staffers who proved themselves on the campaign trail these make up the rest of appointees I know many joined the campaign early with no experience and worked the long, thankless hours and ended up being brought along to the White House as a reward.",Perfectly answers my question.

We accepted it as accurate, Barr said Wednesday while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Source I fell like some of them are misunderstanding the 'underlying evidence' part. He didn't dig deep to find out whether Mueller's statements were true or not. He just accepted the Mueller report as it is. For eg. kamala Harris asked Barr if he had reviewed all the underlying evidence that special counsel Robert Mueller had compiled in order to draw his conclusions. Barr indicated that he hadnt, and noted that he simply took Muellers written report as the evidence itself, determining that Trump had not obstructed justice after reading it. So it seems like he just read the Wikipedia article the Mueller report in this case and not the sources. He just accepted the Mueller report as it is. He said that this approach is a standard practice in which officials at the Department of Justice DOJ often rely on the characterization of the evidence uncovered in an investigation.

mtp296,gv1typg,gv1x4r5, I'm attempting to become more involved with politics at the dinner table. I thought I would stop by here to ask some of you what you think may be contributing to the division in the political world at this point in time. Thank you.," Is it? In a lot of ways, the world is more connected than it has ever been. It is easier for goods, people, and information to travel around the world than it has ever been. In a certain sense, the fact that we see such strong partisan division in so many different societies is actually evidence of these interconnections. Global politics is affecting domestic politics more than ever before. I think it is this new globalized environment that is at least playing a role in political conflict. More people can let their voices be heard. People who might not have found like-minded voices in their own communities or countries can find them around the world. This makes divisions that previously would have been overlooked far more visible. More importantly, many more actors can exert influence on many more people. Today's Martin Luther King's can reach more people with less effort than MLK ever could, but so can today's Hitler's. Another factor has to do with the global movement of people. In many countries, the sharpest divisions are either directly or indirectly, about migration, culture, ethnicity, and race. Brexit, Trump, Hijab bans. etc. Globalization has been moving people around for more than a century, and climate change will only make it happen more in the future. The global movement of goods has upset local economic systems and undermined traditional modes of production. This doesn't just cause economic harm. It also causes dramatic shifts in how cultures understand themselves. If we look historically, though, we might not actually be in such bad shape.

But one that I haven't seen addressed by proponents of making sex work not only legal, but also the same as any other job. Is what happens to people receiving unemployment benefits? You can only receive unemployment benefits if you're actively searching for work, and if you get a job offer you can only turn it down for a good reason. From what I've gathered, I don't like the work I'd be doing is currently not a valid reason. Would this mean that people who are out of a job could be legally forced into prostitution or risk getting nothing at all? If some exception is made to consider I don't want to a valid reason for refusing to take sex work jobs, then wouldn't that be admitting that sex work is NOT the same as regular work? I apologise if there's some sort of fallacy with this question or some obvious answer. It's just really bothering me. Obviously, a UBI would definitely remove the issue this question presents...

stpn6s,hx5boo5,hx5siua,How can the leader of one country demand or dictate what happens in another?,"Don't quote me on this but it has been said that Putin threatening to invade Ukraine is Russia trying to force the West on a negotiating table wrt to Ukraine. There is no justification for Russia to invade Ukraine at all. Instead, Putin wants a guarantee that Ukraine won't join NATO and as a reminder for those outside of UkraineRussia, this tension started in winter of 2013 when Ukraine ousted a pro-Kremlin president for reneging on the trade agreement with the EU at last minute, in favour of a deal with Russia. Putin saw Ukraine signing a deal with the EU as one step closer to joining the bloc and the possibility of joining NATO. I think what we're seeing is a lite version of the Cuban missile crisis, which is threatening the opposition to escalate the situation in order to force the other side into a negotiation. And it seems working for Putin seeing as the West and NATO are scrambling for talks. The losing party here is Ukraine in the worst case scenario. Should the West and Russia decide that Ukraine is a neutral buffer by not letting them join the EU or NATO but not necessarily being close to Russia, this will go against the popular wish of Ukrainians to be part of the West. It sucks to be a strategic country. Goddamn geopolitics and nationalism.","I feel factually NATO has accepted already after the Donbas conflict, that Ukraine wouldn't join them. They just can't outright say so, for relations to the Ukraine. For the Ukrainian government, it also would be a step further into isolation. Its not very cozy to be neutral, partly occupied country sandwiched between two hostile blocks. Still, what Putin really wants is hard to guess right now. The best he can get IMO is the acknowledgement that the Crimea belongs to Russia now. And that would be already a huge stretch for the NATO powers, as they would signal that Russia has a bit of a free reign towards block-free countries where there are plenty of especially along the southern border.

1202lhn,jdfew7w,jdsqvox,"Today I was talking to my students about the line of succession. A student asked what would happen if a VP refused to ascend to the presidency in the event the president vacated. I assume that if that happened, the Speaker would then become president. But does the new president have the authority to fire the VP who refused to ascend to the presidency? One argument I thought about was that the sitting VP could argue that they were democratically elected and therefore can't be removed from the VP office, even by a successor. On the other hand, a why WOULDN'T they want to and b POTUS outranks VP so it likely doesn't matter. But I thought about whether this would trigger a Constitutional crisis since there's not too much outlined about the office of VP in the Constitution.","The vice president becomes the president automatically. They can't refuse, it's not a choice. They can resign though. No they don't become vice president again if they resign as president.","This is correct for VP. However, once you get below that in the line of succession, it does seem that someone could refuse. Reason 1 the exact wording of the constitution and the succession laws do appear to say that while VP becomes president, straight out. That anyone who takes over lower down in the line is simply acting as President without holding the office. So if a speaker of the house were to be in this situation, well the presidency is vacant anyways and will remain so whether the speaker acts as president or not. The lack of automatic succession to the actual office leaves a legal capacity to refuse to start acting as president. Reason 2 at least with the next two folks in the line of succession, they are members of congress. And the constitution is clear that you can't be in Congress and president. So.

Often times in real world data we have have valid data that provides valid truth values yet lack enough data to provide an unbiased answer. To claim a lack bias from the start is an absurdity.

3v0fwa,cxj9x28,cxjv7jn,"Black Lives Matter began as a popular hashtag after the Trayvon Martin incident, and quickly became a national movement in the aftermath of incident at Ferguson. Although originally focused on killings of African-Americans by police across the nation, the movement's founder, Alicia Gray, has since acknowledged that the movement has evolved into a more widespread protest against societal and institutional violence that targets black individuals. The movement has quickly entered the national consciousness, with many referring to it as the new civil rights movement, and protestors using the group's slogans have staged major protests across the US in the last year. The movement has become so culturally pervasive that it has even been featured on a recent episode of Law and Order SVU. However, the movement has faced criticism for both its goals and its tactics. The movement has been accused of fabricating death counts and other statistics, while others worry that the movement promotes anti-white radicalism. Additionally, the movement has been criticized for its methods, with protests blocking roads and public spaces and interrupting or intruding on other causes and organizations Supporters of the movement counter that such tactics are necessary to draw attention to the issues faced by the African-American community. My question is how legitimate are the grievances of BLM? How bad is the problem of racial violence in the US, and are racial issues to blame for the protested social inequities, or are other factors at play? Are BLM's tactics appropriate, or do they go too far?","The grievances are, definitely, legitimate. Minority groups are much more likely to be charged with and convicted of crimes, and their sentences are often longer compared to white convicts. source I know the ACLU isn't exactly unbiased, but I at least trust their fact-checking. The methods of their protests, however, tend to be poorly received by the public, and I think that has a number of factors. In many recent stories, people under the banner of the BLM movement have gone beyond marches and demonstrations, and have actively tried to disrupt large events in an effort to sort of steal the spotlight. Examples 1 2 3 In theory, there's no such thing as bad publicity, so this should work. In practice, I feel they often end up going too far. Blocking train lines and freeways, interrupting political meetings, and the like all end up conveying a sense of antagonism, which creates a dissonance when they turn around and say they're fighting for equality. This kind of points to another fairly large problem- lack of unity. BLM started off as a protest group centered around stopping racism in police forces, largely in response to the Ferguson and Baltimore uproars in the past year. That was an easily defined purpose, and it aligned BLM clearly against 'the bad guys'. Obviously the people who are protesting police racism are the good guys, right? Easy-to-digest, and hard to make them look bad. But since then, their 'purpose' has kind of evolved into a general fight against all forms of economicsocialpolitical racism, which is much harder to define, makes it harder to measure progress, and gives the image of a disorganized mob rather than a passionate crowd. It has a lot of parallels with the 99 rallies, actually. Sure, there's a general feeling across it all racism now, economic injustice then but they seem to be lacking a sense of consistency, of unity.", Minority groups are much more likely to be charged with and convicted of crimes This is not a legitimate grievance if they are actually committing more crimes.  and their sentences are often longer compared to white convicts.

Thank you!,"We can only do a comparison between the old divisions and new. First, historically in the private sector 1994-2014 study of polls indicated that division increased from 1994 to 2014. Pew Research a conservative think tank, found that the trends at that time manifested themselves in both, in politics and in everyday life. The survey of 10,000 adults nationwide finds that these divisions are greatest among those who are the most engaged and active in the political process. Back then 92 of Republicans are to the right of the median Democrat, and 94 of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican.  The more recent and more focused Pew research polls that studied attitudes regarding voting issues April 2021, similarly found a growing division between the American voting population. The share of Republicans who say any voter should be allowed to vote early or absentee without a documented reason has fallen 19 percentage points from 57 to 38. Democrats and Democratic leaners are far more supportive of automatically registering all eligible citizens to vote 82 and no-excuse early voting 84 their views are virtually unchanged in recent years. The new national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted from April 5-11, 2021, among 5,109 adults who are members of the Centers American Trends Panel, also finds wide partisan differences over removing inactive voters from voting registration lists. A 68 majority of Republicans favor removing people from voting registration lists if they have not recently voted or confirmed their registration, compared with just 27 of Democrats. Still, several proposals draw majority support from both Republicans and Democrats, including requiring electronic voting machines to print paper ballots as backups and for making early, in-person voting available for at least two weeks prior to Election Day.  It seems to me that the overall divisions that we see today tend to be more issue based and vary in support depending on the issue. There is, for instance, majority support for many of the Biden's big agendas it is different, however, when it comes to voting rights and division develops. ","Pew Research a conservative think tank, Very thorough reply with good sources! I would push back against your claim that Pew is conservative, however. ",NeutralPolitics
7b7akb,dpg5ax6,dpg8aw5,"As there is an ongoing rhetoric about fake news I recently thought of the former Fairness Doctrine in the US and if it should be put back in place.  The Fairness Doctrine was a policy of the United States Federal Communications Commission FCC, introduced in 1949, that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that wasin the Commission's viewhonest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987 and removed the rule that implemented the policy from the Federal Register in August 2011.  What would the benefits and costs be if the FCC  US were to establish this rule for media companies once again? Would or could this possibly address the issues at hand?   ","I don't advocate regulating internet speech, but the fairness doctrine has no benefit in the world of internet focused media without that aspect. Worth starting here  Because obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment, it is prohibited on cable, satellite and broadcast TV and radio. However, the same rules for indecency and profanity do not apply to cable, satellite TV and satellite radio because they are subscription services. The FCC does not regulate internet speech, or that of Satellite broadcasts. The costs incurred would be incredibly high to regulate, and even higher to enforce, maybe even impossible. The fairness doctrine was established in 1949, and served it's purpose when communication was expensive, and people were only listening on radio  TV - something that anyone w a transmitter has the ability to broadcast to. It's no longer relevant in the internet age - or at least no longer enforceable. This would require 100 of the websites on the internet to be examined on an ongoing basis, scanned for all the same rules that apply as broadcast television, and regulated accordingly. Completely ignoring the political implications of such a clamp down, there are 300 hours of video added to YouTube per minute that would need to be screened for fairness, not including every post that was added to Facebook. Google can't keep up with it at the pace something spreads virally, I have no confidence that a public endeavor could do better. I'm not even sure how YouTube alone could be handled, ignoring every other site on the internet. That would mean 300 60  18,000 people listening and determining if 1 there's a political bias 2 whether there's an opposite viewpoint. The other side of this would be hardware logistics required for enforcement. Every ISP would then need to be able to segment traffic based on location - the internet is inherently an international commodity, with some big caveats  China blocking major search hubs for example. A system would need to be devised for availability of traffic based on an agreed upon algorithm in relation to fairness in real time. Billions in infrastructure changes? Trillions? There would also be a huge shakeup in the cost of doing business on the internet as well as how startups work, grow, and thrive in that environment. Do adult sites get a pass? Does that mean that a blogger has to post 50 of their content as an opposing view? Many many unanswered questions. Costs very high. Benefit is cloudy. I'm not sure it's even possible to enforce without full violation of several amendments. ","What if you only applied it to larger journalistic groups? Joe Schmoe and his Daily Youtube Show probably isn't worth regulating to begin with, but larger organizations that bring in a lot of traffic Say, Breitbart or Mother Jones, for instance, as well as traditional news organizations are a much clearer target for enforcement. As long as you define a clear qualifier for being a major news media outlet, enforcement should still be viable.",NeutralPolitics

It's hard to explain, because things have changed so much. It's hard to explain how weird the word Homeland sounds in the ear of a pre-911 American. I can only say that it's not an American word. It's an Old World word. It's a medieval word, a communist word, a Nazi word. It's a word used by people who identify themselves as an ethnicity, a tribe. It's not a word used by a people who identify themselves in terms of a philosophy based on universal ideals. I wish I were more eloquent. I wish I could explain. So much has changed. It's a word used by a besieged, defensive and frightened people not a word used by a confident, optimistic, powerful people. It's a word for serfs.

This raises the question of how things would have gone differently for someone in the same situation under the proposed AHCA. See here and also consider the recent proposed changes to coverage of preexisting conditions. Of course, he's rich and would have been fine either way. What would the outcome be for a poorer family in the same situation without health insurance? What about a family with health insurance? A family with preexisting conditions before the pregnancy? A family with high-deductible coverage? Etc. What are the major differences between how this situation would unfold under AHCA versus ACA? I understand that some of these outcomes depend on the state the family lives in and whether that state opts out of the preexisting conditions coverage clause.","A poor family would still get treatment for their son depending on the state they live in but would be bed-ridden with medical bills likely forcing them to file for bankruptcy and become even more subsidized by the federal government. It really comes down to location, location, location. This bill allows states to opt out and NOT cover pre existing conditions if they so choose. What this means is that any opted out states can then charge as much as they want for insurance to people with pre-existing conditions, and likely price low income families out of the market. Take a state like Kansas, for example, whose economy is not doing so hot right now for a multitude of reasons... states like this would likely be the first to pull out of the pre-existing condition program.","And of course, they poor are less likely to be able to choose the state they live in.

1dp6v5,c9sif4d,c9sqokk,"It used to be that the state had a monopoly on mass violence. Conflicts between individual citizens could result in a few deaths or injuries, but casualty figures pretty much scaled linearly with the number of people involved. To inflict mass casualties required involvement of the state, with its huge resources and logistical expertise. This requirement often though, not always acted as a safeguard against random acts of mass violence. But in the modern world, advances in technology have placed mass violence in the hands of the individual citizens. The potential number of casualties per perpetrator has risen dramatically with the advent of IEDs ANFO bombs and automatic assault weapons America was plunged into this reality with the Oklahoma City bombing That was followed by 911 and now we've got the Boston Marathon bombings. In between, there have been mass shooting incidents where a one or two perpetrators have been able to claim the lives of dozens of victims. I think it's safe to assume the march of technology cannot be halted. The information and experience needed to create simple weapons that produce mass casualties is only getting more widespread. Just today, there was a news report that the 3D-printed handgun is now a reality So, if we want to limit these incidents of violence, we're going to have to deal with the individuals who perpetrate them, not the tools they use to wreak their havoc. The question is, how do we do that? I've heard people argue that a lot of these incidents come down to a mental health problem, and reforming our mental health system is a key factor in prevention. I'm sure there's some truth to that, but it can't be the whole story. Some of these crimes are politically motivated. Political bombings in Northern Ireland, Israel and Spain were commonplace for decades, but they seem to have been largely resolved. How did those countries deal with the problem? I've heard other arguments amounting to an acceptance that there will always be evil-doers, so limiting civil liberties is the only way to prevent these incidents in the future. But there are plenty of countries that haven't limited civil liberties and they're not suffering from frequent attacks, so again, this seems not to be a definitive answer. The upshot is, access to the means of causing mass violence is basically universal, but the violence itself is not. What can the places that are suffering from such violence learn from the places that aren't? TLDR The world is getting smaller and destructive technology is getting more accessible. What do we need to change so we can all live together peacefully? ----- EDIT Some responses indicate that people think this post is about or advocating gun control, so let me clarify this in a way that I hope Second Amendment advocates of which I am one will understand. Let's take it as a given that guns don't kill people people kill people. Assume the same holds for bombs and IEDs. All of those weapons, depending on their power, allow for a single attacker to cause multiple casualties, and all have become easie to acquirebuild in recent years. Signs indicate that trend will continue and any efforts to reverse it are futile. OK? No taking of guns. No effective regulation of pressure cookers or fertilizer. We're all able to arm ourselves, whether or not we intend to. Now, if we accept all that, how do we reduce incidents of mass violence caused by one or two individuals? In other words, if it's the people, not the weapons, who are the killers, how do we fix people? And isn't that going to become more important as the availability of weapons of mass violence increases?","There has been no increase in mass shootings since the 1970s despite the increase in availability to semi-automatic firearms. source1 source2 The bombings you mentioned are different from the mass shootings as they are politically motivated. OKC bombing was a direct response to Waco, and 911 and Boston bombings are both a direct response to US military presence in the middle east. I think it's important to distinguish the politically motivated from the mental health ones. Personally I think the biggest problem is the 24 hour news media scaring people to give up their rights and making martyrs out of villains.","I do agree the real issue revolves around the over-hyping and the speed of information. Naturally we when I say we I mean humanity, or as a society are curious creatures, and when here event X is mentioned, we try to get as much information out of it, and we throughout a typical week, will slowly get spoon-fed bits of watered-down facts coated in opinions. Source I have no source, but, from reasoning as an engineer, I can assure that the level of technological advancement, does extend a persons capability to commit harm, but, it comes at a higher cost of time, money, knowledge, and in some cases, legal finesse. These new found capabilities might make us seem more destructive. That would be true, except as dangerous mankind's progression might seem to be, we must not forget that we have also advanced in morality, medicine specifically diagnosing, general welfare and the amplitude for civil service. We are all taught about value of human life. We are getting closer to having our human needs met cheaper. We encourage one another to be supportive in each others community. Today, all of mankind can look at their ancestors, and see that they are more civilized. Technology, is always neutral, the person putting it to use is not. I believe access to technology and all its constructs shouldn't be limited.A good example is explosives. Society won't know what the purpose is when someone produces thematic compound would be used for a model rocket, or a primary explosive for an IED. Society, if it suppresses the knowledge and acquisition of said compound, may not stop person who wants to harm society, but it may stop the lawful one from advancing it. ",NeutralPolitics

3c5037,csshmdq,cssuq3z,"Congress just extended a ban on CDC research on gun violence. Boehner explains the vote by saying  The CDC is there to look at diseases that need to be dealt with to protect public health. Im sorry, but a gun is not a disease. Which to me, kind of sidesteps the matter of whether there is a benefit to Americans that US gun violence merits further study, and if so, what group is best suited to perform it. Personally, I have to admit that hearing let's not study this sounds a lot like the establishment wanting the populace to remain ignorant about something that has life and death implications. The conventional understanding is that the US has the highest per capita rate of firearm-related murders of all developed countries though is minuscule compared to places like Honduras, El Salvador, Jamaica, etc.. The Washington Post has a useful table that can be sorted along several criteria. I know that discussion on guns makes passions run deep but I'm hoping the neutrons can do it right. To this end, I'm hoping we can focus the discussion away from the subject of restrictions we might fear and focus instead on what I think is a smaller topic  the value of ongoing research, and if there is value,  what entity is best suited to perform said research  what factors should be examined I put this to the group because I'm somewhat undecided on where I stand and believe that I first need to understand a subject before picking sides.","Research needs to be done and perhaps a combination of the CDC and FBI. The CDC creates the needed study paramiters and analyzes the data and the FBI collects it with the help of local law enforcement. Bear in mind this will most likely only catch those incidents where guns are used for suicide, crime, and self defense. I would also have the CDC create a census kind of question aire for gun owners to fill out. How practice is all this, no idea, just some thoughts. Edit For factors I would like to see -average number of negligent discharges -when gun was used in cases of domestic violence -use in self defense -if gun owner was a victim of his own gun during a crime -if and how often gun owners lock away their guns and ammunition -use in suicides this should largely be available already -if they purchased the gun and it was used in anyway crime how did they purchase through proper gun dealer or 3rd party. ","One of the problems I foresee is the self defense issue. For private citizens and police alike, simply having and holding the firearm can end a conflict or dangerous encounter. In many cases when firearms are draw by police criminals will acquiesce and surrender, and for private citizens many attackers will flee. Much of these particularly for private citizens will never be reported.",NeutralPolitics

LINK The Guardian looks at this issue HERE The Gifford Center makes the case for banning military assault rifles HERE A central point made is The military features that distinguish assault weapons from standard sporting firearms enable shooters to spray large amounts of ammunition quickly while retaining control of the gun. This is an interesting LINK There is no standard definition of what constitutes a mass shooting.

LINK So what is the evidence that specific rifles or large-capacity magazines are the real issue? While it is also interesting to discuss laws and policies that might have reduced the effects, the central question is how to prevent mass shootings.","IMHO, asking about outright prevention is tricky, and it's better to instead think about what would be effective at preventing similar incidents in the future. A couple years ago the NY Times asked several experts in the field what they thought would be the most effective measures at reducing deaths from mass shootings  There was also a panel study published earlier this year which looked at the impact of state firearm laws on firearm deaths. Their main findings   The outcome measures were the annual age-adjusted rates of homicide and suicide in each state during the period 19912016. We controlled for a wide range of state-level factors.  Universal background checks were associated with a 14.9 95 CI, 5.223.6 reduction in overall homicide rates, violent misdemeanor laws were associated with a 18.1 95 CI, 8.127.1 reduction in homicide, and shall issue laws were associated with a 9.0 95 CI, 1.117.4 increase in homicide. These laws were significantly associated only with firearm-related homicide rates, not non-firearm-related homicide rates. None of the other laws examined were consistently related to overall homicide or suicide rates. In the above, I think violent misdemeanor laws refers to firearm restrictions for those guilty of violent misdemeanors."," think violent misdemeanor laws refers to firearm restrictions for those guilty of violent misdemeanors. Typically these are targeted at domestic abuse and sometimes stalking.

5rzljq,ddbnjx5,ddc2tcl,"I've seen Trump repeatedly called fascist on news sites, Facebook, etc. Here are some examples The main characteristics of fascist leadership, according to Lawrence Britt are nationalism, disdain for human rights, use of scapegoats, military supremacy, sexism, control over the mass media, obsession with national security, combination of religion and government, protection of corporate power, suppression of labor power, disdain for intellectualsthe arts, obsession with crime and punishment, rampant corruption and cronyism, and fradulent elections. Which of these do Trump's policies align with, and to what extent is it accurate to classify him as a fascist? ","Defining fascism will always be controversial, but going by the characteristics in the OP... nationalism Make America Great Again and America First are perfect examples of nationalist slogans, the latter phrase has some history and foreign policy implications. Trump advisor Steve Bannon has been accused of being a white nationalist, which he denies, while embracing the term nationalist or economic nationalist. disdain for human rights Trump is pro-torture and has argued for targeting the families of terrorists use of scapegoats When Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending their best. Theyre not sending you. Theyre not sending you. Theyre sending people that have lots of problems, and theyre bringing those problems with us. Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. military supremacy Trump has called for an increase in military spending arguing that History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest. We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military dominance. In fairness, this is pretty standard talk for Republicans, and some Democrats, too.  sexism Trump was caught on tape bragging about sexual assault. Granted that that is not policy related, but I think it bears mentioning. It does reflect on the man, and on the base that supported him in spite of those comments. Trump has also appointed the fewest women to his cabinet since George HW Bush. control over the mass media Trump has called for opening libel law to make it easier to go after news organizations. He has a famously hostile relationship with the media, recently labeling them the opposition. It's clear that this does not constitute control over the mass media, but he has an unusually hostile relationship with the press, and has signaled a desire to erode freedom of the press. obsession with national security Trump's administration has defended his recent travel ban as a necessary measure to protect the homeland. Perhaps his most famous campaign promise, which he appears to be following through on, is to build a wall to secure the southern border. combination of religion and government I don't think anything Trump has done or promised rises to the level of combining religion and government, but he has promised to destroy the Johnson amendment, which would allow religious organizations to be more involved politics. protection of corporate power Trump is in the process of rolling back regulations. This is standard Republican stuff, to be fair. suppression of labor power Trump has expressed support for so-called right-to-work legislation which would diminish labor union power 'I love the right to work, he said last February. It is better for the people. You are not paying the big fees to the unions.'. Again, pretty standard Republican stuff. disdain for intellectualsthe arts Trump reportedly wants to privatize PBS and eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities. He rejects scientific opinion on climate change and has stripped Government websites of references to climate change. obsession with crime and punishment Trump has threatened to send the feds to Chicago to end the carnage there. He has denounced a purported dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America and promised to end it. rampant corruption and cronyism Trump has failed to meaningfully divest from his business, instead handing it over to his son. I don't think this yet qualifies as rampant corruption, but it's well worth keeping an eye on. fradulent elections I do not think there is any evidence of fraudulent elections. Trump might disagree. Taken together, I don't think there's a slam-dunk case for Trump as a fascist under the definition of the OP, but there clear fascist leanings for almost every trait. "," combination of religion and government  I don't think anything Trump has done or promised rises to the level of combining religion and government, but he has promised to destroy the Johnson amendment, which would allow religious organizations to be more involved politics. I think it's worth noting a couple of things here  At the conference, Bannon said that godlessness and libertarianism have sapped the strength of the Judeo-Christian West to defend its ideals, and the Muslim world is growing in numbers. Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didnt act, he said. More  But our forefathers didnt do it, either. And they were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to bequeath to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind, so I think its incumbent on all of us to do what I call a gut check, to really think about what our role is in this battle thats before us. Lastly for balance, a piece about bannon from breitbart, with religious overtones  Obviously bannon isn't trump, and I can't find a direct call for a more religious government specifically, but Bannon repeatedly refers to a war between the Judeo-Christrian west and secularism, and also with Islam. He is very much of the opinion of increasing the role of Christianity in our day to day lives, so it's important as well to keep an eye on how he pushes these beliefs on the Trump agenda.",NeutralPolitics

Although an argument to cuts for federal employees may be warranted, All spending on federal employees makes up 267 billion dollars of the budget meaning Trump could literally eliminate ALL federal employees and still not make up the deficit from his tax cuts.

The republicans are using the budget to muscle the democrats into abandoning their victory. I don't think the republicans have a realistic chance of pulling this off, so the question remains, why doesn't Boehner just call a vote for a clean CR and let the congressional democrats and moderate republicans pass a budget?

gs8i90,fs4b39w,fs5jusv,"According to multiple sources President Trump will sign an executive order today that will attempt to change some protections that social media companies are given under Section 230 This comes after Twitter added a short fact-check to his tweet about mail-in ballots The draft of the EO available here under Section 4, cites two SCOTUS cases Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins and Packingham v. North Carolina as precedence. What other, if any, legal precedence exists to supportrebut the President's Executive Order?","The draft order does several different things 1. Instruct the FCC to issue new regulations relating to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act I'll return to this. 2. Potentially restrict federal agencies from advertising on platforms judged to engage in viewpoint-based speech restrictions the section heading here refers to a prohibition but the text actually just requests a review Insofar as this is actually just a review, there's no real legal problem. 3. Create a report on bias in online platforms and recommend that the FTC consider appropriate action Again, this doesn't actually do anything interesting although it could be the first step towards something else. 4. Establish a working group with state attorneys general on online bias Again, this doesn't really do anything. The action here is really on the first item. The other three could end up going in a variety of directions but don't presently represent clear proposals to do anything with interesting legal implications. So, let's focus on 1 which requires understanding what Section 230 does and why. Keep in mind that Section 230 is a statute, so it cannot be modified by an executive order. At most, an executive order can change within reason how executive agencies interpret a statute. Section 230 immunity comes from 47 U.S. Code Section 230c1 This reads in full No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. That probably sounds rather boring, but it's often been called the twenty-six words that created the internet To understand why, we have to take a bit of a trip through libel and defamation law. Eugene Volokh just published an excellent summary on this topic, so I'll refer you there for a more detailed account. In brief, prior to Section 230, there was a dispute about the level of responsibility held by an online platform for what someone else writes on said platform. That is, if I post something defamatory on Reddit, then what is Reddit's responsibility for that content? If Reddit is a publisher like, say, a newspaper, then Reddit is responsible for the content and you can sue Reddit if I defame you via Reddit. If, on the other hand, Reddit is merely a distributor or platform then they are not liable for what I say just because they happen to have transmitted it. You can think of this as the difference between a newspaper and a news stand. If a newspaper publishes a letter to the editor from some random citizen, they assume some responsibility for its content including defamatory content because they vetted the letter and chose to publish it. On the other hand, the owner of the news stand that sells the newspaper probably didn't even read it, and isn't held responsible for the content. The trucker that brings the newspaper from the printer to the news stand is even less responsible -- it would seem totally unreasonable to hold them liable here. So, is a website more like the newspaper, the news stand, or the trucker? Before the Communications Decency Act, courts took the position that a website that did not exercise any editorial control was like a news stand -- not responsible for the content. However, in Stratton Oakmont v. Prodigy Services the court held that a site that exercised any editorial control thereby became a publisher. So, just censoring profanity or other fairly trivial content policies transformed you into a publisher, who was liable for defamation like a newspaper would be. For an internet company, liability for defamation would be a business-ending catastrophe. Reddit, Facebook, Twitter none of these actually existed yet of course would be exposed to a lawsuit any time anyone uses their site to defame someone else which happens constantly. They would be rapidly bankrupted. Thus, the pre-CDA regime created a perverse incentive for companies not to moderate content at all so that they would be treated as distributors rather than publishers. Censor our curse words to make you're site kid-friendly? Now you're liable for everything on your site. Let people post horrifying torture porn without interfering? No liability. It's a simple business decision to just allow people to do whatever they want you still have to remove illegal content on request but that's a different issue. So, Congress included Section 230 in the CDA for the purpose of making it safe for internet companies to moderate content without thereby exposing themselves to liability for what their users did. In fact, the legal treatment was basically to give internet companies the level of immunity enjoyed by the trucker rather than the news stand in the example above. There's a debate about whether this went too far in limiting internet company liability, but the alternative was to make it impossible for companies to moderate anything. Circling back around, certain conservatives believe that Facebook, Twitter, etc. have abused this regime by censoring speech on a political basis and that this ought to transform them into publishers who are then liable for third party content on their sites like a newspaper would be. Obviously, the President cannot change a law passed by Congress unilaterally, and that applies to the CDA. The Executive Order envisions I think this part gets too in the weeds to be interesting but see my followup if you want to read more, however, a way of reinterpreting Section 230 such that platforms that remove content for certain reasons including alleged political bias would forfeit their Section 230 immunity. This would be the death penalty for internet companies -- even Facebook or Google's resources could not possibly survive the onslaught of defamation suits, so they would have to cave and stop moderating content. That may sound like a big deal, but it's basically toothless. The proposal is to do this via FCC rule-making, but Section 230 defends internet companies against private lawsuits. If you attempt to sue Facebook for some content posted by a user, then Section 230 allows Facebook to get that lawsuit immediately dismissed. The FCC is not part of that process, and an executive order doesn't get to change how courts interpret the law if you're into this stuff, it's worth noting an interesting contrast in what Trump appears to be hoping for here and his administration's attitude towards Chevron deference but maybe no one else finds that amusing. So, is there a precedent? Absolutely. Trump wants to go back to the pre-CDA regime governing the internet. Is it workable legally? No, not really. In this game of rock-paper-scissors, a statute beats an executive order. Is this a big deal? Yes, but for a different reason. I would guess that every lawyer and lobbyist for a tech company is currently quietly panicking, not because this executive order is itself threatening but because it might be the first shot in a broader war to change the legal regime governing the internet. TLDR The order doesn't actually do anything, but laws sure are interesting. Edit See my follow up post on the legal theory used in the Executive Order to reinterpret Section 230.","Thank you for all your work on this, but you missed a pretty big chunk of 230 which is specifically addressed by this executive order. The title of the subsection containing the 26 words is Protection for Good Samaritan blocking and screening of offensive material. It is applicable to those providers who restrict access to objectionable material in good faith. This order argues that the disparate application of removal actions by these companies based not upon the substance of the content itself, but based on the users race, religion, or political viewpoint is not done in good faith and therefore does not qualify as Good Samaritan blocking or screening, and such a policy andor practice would cause them to lose their protection from civil liability under 230.",NeutralPolitics

Conversations that I've been privy to between senior Democratic organizers and activists are almost a 11 between similar types of people on the Republican camp. There's less overt conspiratorial thinking and religiosity but I think it would shock most people if they could get a Democrat operative to freely share their opinion on things like homelessness and minimum wage. There's also a very strong tokenizing bent in Democratic circles towards people of color, immigrants, and LGBTQ people. You are valuable if you reflect the dominant party line and you will absolutely be discarded if you don't. I remember a voter enrollment campaign I was part of some years back, I was happy to see that part of the campaign's guidelines was that a certain minimum number of campaign workers had to be LGBTQ because the campaign was going to be working in an area with a decent LGBTQ population. When placement decisions were being made, I noticed they were fulfilling that mandate by putting LGBTQ people on staff but in positions where that aspect of them was functionally irrelevant. There was no effort made to specifically place LGBTQ people in positions where they might be interacting with the community that this mandate was put in place with a mind towards. Now I don't think it was explicit, thought out homophobia, they just made no effort to abide by the spirit of that mandate even when they had qualified candidates to go in these positions.",Where were you working when you were part of voter campaigns and whatnot?,PoliticalDebate
185kpcf,kb422xh,kb4fsuq,"Do you know why it exist? Read Pre.1 Overview of the Preamble  Pre.2 Historical Background on the Preamble   Pre.3 Legal Effect of the Preamble   The Preambles origins predate the Constitutional Convention  The tradition of a legal preamble continued in the New World. The Declarations and Resolves of the First Continental Congress in 1774 included a preamble noting the many grievances the thirteen colonies held against British rule.  5 Building on this document, in perhaps the only preamble that rivals the fame of the Constitutions opening lines, the Declaration of Independence of 1776 announced We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  The initial draft of the Constitutions Preamble was, however, fairly brief and did not specify the Constitutions objectives. As released by the Committee of Detail on August 6, 1787, this draft stated We the People of the States of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, do ordain, declare and establish the following Constitution for the Government of Ourselves and our Posterity.  13 While this draft was passed unanimously by the delegates,  14 the Preamble underwent significant changes after the draft Constitution was referred to the Committee of Style on September 8, 1787. Perhaps with the understanding that the inclusion of all thirteen of the states in the Preamble was more precatory than realistic,  15 the Committee of Style, led by Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania,  16 replaced the opening phrase of the Constitution with the now-familiar introduction We, the People of the United States.  17 Moreover, the Preamble, as altered by Morris, listed six broad goals for the Constitution to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty -------------- ....... The Supreme Court subsequently endorsed Justice Storys view of the Preamble, holding in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that, while the Constitutions introductory paragraph indicates the general purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution. With regard to the legal effect of the Constitutions preface, in the early years of the Supreme Court, it did reference the Preambles words in some of the most important cases interpreting the Constitution. For example, in 1793, two Members of the Court cited the Preamble in Chisholm v. Georgia to argue that the people, in establishing the Constitution, necessarily subjected the State of Georgia to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in exchange for accomplishing the six broad goals listed in the Constitutions Preamble. x200B The Preamble appears to have had a more significant influence outside of judicial opinions in statements from the leaders of the political branches of government, often factoring in various debates during the early history of the nation. For instance, during the debates in the First Congress over the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States, congressional leaders, like Elbridge Gerry of the Massachusetts, quoted the Preamble to note the broad objects for which the Constitution was established and to justify the establishment of a national bank to promote the general welfare.14 And the Preamble featured in early congressional debates over the role of the new government in foreign affairs. For example, during the Tenth Congress, Henry Southard of New Jersey cited the Preamble in arguing in favor of Congress arming and equipping the militia of the United States, recognizing that it was the object of the establishment of the federal government to provide for the common defence against foreign enemies. 15 Perhaps one of the most famous references to the Preamble in the halls of Congress came in a speech of Senator Daniel Webster in the midst of the nullification debates of the 1830s, wherein he quoted the Preamble to argue that the Constitution was perpetual and immortal, establishing a union which shall last through all time. 16 While the Preamble may have had particular relevance to a number of isolated questions before the Congress in the Nations early years, Presidents and congressional leaders have more generally relied on the Preambles laudatory phrases in exploring the broader import of the Constitution and the general purposes of American government. For instance, President James Monroe referred to the Preamble as the Key of the Constitution, 17 and in his inaugural address, President John Quincy Adams described the first words of the Constitution as declaring the purposes for which the government should be invariably and sacredly devoted. 18 Echoing these themes in his own first inaugural address, President Abraham Lincoln invoked the Preambles perfect union language to note the importance of national unity as the country faced the brink of civil war. 19 In the midst of another constitutional crisisR12that which arose in 1937 amid clashes over the constitutionality of the New DealR12 President Franklin Roosevelt stated the need to read and reread the preamble of the Constitution, as its words suggested that the document could be used as an instrument of progress, and not as a device for prevention of action. 20 Decades later, Representative Barbara Jordan, the first African-American woman elected to the House of Representatives from the South, quoted the Preamble in a statement before the House Judiciary Committee as it considered the Articles of Impeachment for President Richard Nixon.21 In that statement, she noted that through the process of amendment, interpretation, and court decision she had been included in We, the people and was now serving as an inquisitor aiming to preserve the goals of the Constitution. x200B x200B",What is the debate here?,They are a Progressive of some shade and are saying as long as the ever centralizing and expanding federal government uses the six pillars of the Preamble in their arguments it will increase their political capital to make it happen.,PoliticalDebate

174wiog,k4cd9vg,k4ce304,"I set out on a path to learn socialism and communism about 2-3 years ago, and it took about that much time to finally understand it. There's a lot of misinformation, disinformation, confusion, and ignorance on the subject from both Communists and everyone else. I have never seen anything so properly buried, trying to learn communism is like digging for the bones of a T Rex. Never in my life have I met someone who understands communism, and never have I run into anyone online who understand it other than some Communists themselves. The right wingers and the majority of western liberals look at it historically and think the USSR was communist because it was led by a Communist party. Same thing with China. But, if they would simply Google communism, they'd see the various requirements that the USSR did not even come close to meeting, like The requirement of a global socialists revolution as a precursor, becoming stateless, moneyless, and having a voluntary workforce. Most people think that because the Bolshevisks successfully revolutionized that they had achieved communism and communists support that authoritarian government, but that's not even close. If I had to explain it simply Communism is not simply and ideology, it is a structure for a NEW WORLD ORDER. Communism is a very specific thing, the absolute end of point of socialism having been established globally for years. The USSR was arguably not even socialist, 1000 not communist. If there was a stateless, moneyless, country with a voluntary workforce capitalist countries would imperialize immediately and destroy it. Communism is incompatible with a capitalist world and that is why it has never existed. Communists need a global revolution in order to have a chance to ever implement communism. Marxism-Leninism was the first method of taking steps towards it, after Russia they needed everyone else to revolutionize, but they didn't do they got stuck. Ive explained all this many times but it's difficult to learn. It takes years of studies, and a lot of reading. It's far from a simple concept. If you all are really interested in learning it, the sidebar has  and ","My answer to this is undoubtedly shaped by my own experience in engaging with communist thought, and my perspective as an anarchist communist, but I dont think its quite so simple or straightforward as that. You seem to talk of understanding communism as some ontologically-independent thing which is and can be understood as communism as-such I dont think this is the case at all. Communism cannot adequately be boiled down to the long-term establishment of such and such a world order. To do this ignores how much I would argue most of the communist tradition has rejected this definition on at least an implicit level in their rhetoric and praxis. Communism also cannot be entirely defined according to the Marxist tradition, because of non-Marxist communist thought like anarchist communism and the fact that Marx himself acknowledges in the Manifesto how communist discourse was taking place before he ever published a robust definition of the movement. In short, I dont think communism can really be understood as some single thing or idea that is to comprehended and judged as it is. Communism is far more akin to an intellectual tradition or school of thought, with great variance and diversity even in the presence of its mainstream expression of the Marxist tradition.","I think that what exactly it is is up for debate in terms of actual policy, like we have many capitalist countries but they're all very different in terms of how they govern.

Although there is some truth to that most of that truth is related to confusion around terms and definitions. See, the terms originate from the National Assembly during the French Revolution. Sitting on the left were bourgeois liberals who wanted a constitutional monarchy, abolition of the three estates system, free trade, and the state to respect and protect property rights. Sitting on the right were the aristocracy and high clergy who wanted to maintain the absolute monarchy, the three estates, mercantilism, and the authority of the state seize property. Not present at the assembly were the urban workforceproletariat and the peasantry who came to known as the sans-culottes, they sought the complete abolition of the monarchy and even more radical changes like land redistribution and direct democracy, the came to known as far-leftusually as an insult by the bourgeois liberals. Form the origins of the terms we see that the terms definitions of the of are pretty easy to pinpoint. Its equality vs. hierarchy. The liberals at the national assembly wanted equal rights under the law and equal opportunity to engage in trade and entrepreneurship. The sans-culottes who wanted even more political equality were thus even farther left. The aristocrats and high clergy on the want to maintain the traditional hierarchies of the Ancien Rgime. Of course words dont actually mean anything, so what Im arguing here isnt that left-right actually mean equality vs. hierarchy but that equality vs. hierarchy is essentially the main political divide. For example a lot of neoliberals assert that the main political divide is big government vs. small government. This divide fails as they support big government when it reinforces hierarchypolice militarization, interventionism, mass surveillance and support small government when it reinforces hierarchyeconomic deregulation, cutting welfare, economic globalization. All other political divides, socialism vs. capitalism, libertarianism vs. authoritarianism, progressivism vs traditionalism, all essentially stem from whether a hierarchy is justified or not.",AuthoritarianLibertarian and CapitalistSocialist is better.,Where you put a Distributist?

And for a sequel to a movie that made about 1.1 Billion Dollars, it's not doing so hot From what I've heard from the folks over at , the movie is tracking worse than the work of pure cinema that is Morbius, but with a much larger budget. With this film almost guaranteed to be a financial loss, this adds onto a general sense that the MCU is declining, if not in monetary terms than in quality and popularity. While there may be gems like Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and Black Panther Wakanda Forever, the prophesized time of people getting tired of superhero movies might be here. But that's not all. propriety, the propriety of people getting tired of superhero movies might be here. Disney has also released other movies this year, with some mixed results. But I want to focus on the films that had the highest expectations Indiana Jones the Dial of Destiny made 384 Million on a budget of about 200-300 million. That might sound good, if not for the fact that studios actually get about half of the gross revenue from theatrical releases. Yeah. Elemental made 495 Million of a budget of 200 Million. That's objectively good performance, but it's a clear decline from past movies like Incredibles 2 just a few years earlier 608 million budget, 1.2 Billion worldwide earnings. The Little Mermaid2023 made about 570 Million on 297 Million of budget. This is ok, but still a clear departure from past live-action Disney movies like The Lion King2019, which made 1.66 Billion on about 250 Million. Hello everyone, glad to be in a sub for something I quite like. and Haunted Mansion2023, but that would take way too long?

Many reasons have been discussed  Milking IP or milking the same tropes too much, too fast  not properly planning movies, leading to reshoots and crunched VFX teams  too much content, leading to dilution of brands  The pandemic conditioning people to wait for movies to come out on Disney instead of watching in theaters But there is one reason I have also seen discussed Ideological Capture Basically, the theory is that the writersproducersexecutives at Disney are trying to push a liberal ideology in their products at the expense of quality. One commonly cited example is The Little Mermaid2023, specifically Halle Bailey as Ariel. Personally, I think she was a great actress and singer in the film, but what the people arguing about this point want to focus on is that she doesn't look like Ariel from the film, leading to viewers, especially overseas, not being as pulled in by nostalgia as they were for other live-action remakes. This is just one among many theories, but they all have the common is arguing that Disney is tastelessly putting womenPOC in roles without considering good writing and filmmaking first. Personally, I subscribe more to the reasons I listed earlier, but I'd love to hear what you guys think. Do you think that the creators at Disney have prioritized social justice messaging at the expense of quality in their films, thereby leading to a decline in quality and thus financial success? Thanks in advance for replying.","I mean, if this were an issue then Barbie wouldnt have been huge, right? I think the issue has more to do with 1.

I think this issue for me is also compounded by things like neurodiversity and ethnography. How I use something is different than how someone else might use it. This is even more true with people who are neurodiverse. I am not saying a neurodiverse nation would work, but finding a community that can help calm some of the trauma from such conditions is helpful. I know for myself trying to balance different priorities and trying to find a community that allows me freedom to be me without some restriction hitting me in the face is small. However, whether it be in the guise of mixed market capitalist or more socialist economies, there always seems to be restrictions that get in the way of self actualization. x200B This is not to discount terrorism or true evils in our world today, I get that, but it just seems like the nation state is not the best bargain for many people.

18b58d7,kc3b68m,kc4dc0m,"Another week, another post with an inordinate amount of effort put into it. This post assumes that you know what American Customary Units and Metric units are. I've recently been thinking of ways to hook more readers into these posts, so this time I'm trying out a new tactic nostalgia. Imagine that it's September 1999, in the US. Despite all the worrying about Y2K, it's been a great year. You watched both The Matrix and Star Wars Episode 1 in theaters this year, but you felt like that Blair Witch movie was too amateur and are looking forward to Fight Club. Sonic is finally back to compete against Mario, and you think that your choice to get the Dreamcast was the obvious one just due to the superior specs. Ever since the bubble crashed, your Princess Diana Beanie Baby has been rotting in your closet, but you invested in Pets.com so your financial future is secure. If you don't like any of that stuff, please ignore what I just said. In any case, a lot of things are happening at this time. For example, last year NASA launched the Mars Climate Orbiter, which is not only going to find water on Mars but also serve as a communications station for the Polar Lander. How exciting! You're waiting for news on when the orbiter, well, goes into a stable orbit. However, it was not to be. On September 23, 1999, the planned orbital insertion maneuver went awry and NASA lost radio contact. It seems that it went too close to the planet, and paid the price. But why? An investigation would later reveal that the fault was not in the orbiter but in the ground software used to calculate the descent. A portion of the software made by Lockheed Martin calculated things in United States Customary Units, also known as Imperial Units1. However, its Software Interface Specification said that it worked in SI units, also known as Metric Units2. This is bad because the NASA program using this data expected those SI units. This sounds like a minor error, but in reality, is as bad of a translation and cultural exchange as if an Australian called their American friends the C-word, or if Italians were forced to eat Taco Bell's Mexican Pizza. A simple unit mismatch caused the destruction of a 327.6 million project, which is more like 500 million in today's money3. This of course raises the question why doesn't the US use the metric system for everything?  Why does the US Have its Own Units Anyway? Well, technically, they're not exclusive to the US Canada and the UK still use Imperial Measurements to some degree. But only the US sticks to these non-metric units for everything from rulers to highways. To understand why, it's important to understand why US customary units exist in the first place. As far as I understand, there are a few main reasons why the US doesn't use metric 1. It industrialized relatively early in history. Standards of weights and measures are really important for making precise machinery and conducting scientific experiments. Therefore, the nation needed to adopt a standard that was widely used at the time. Which leads me to... 2. The British, the nation and empire at the center of the Industrial Revolution, were still using imperial units. It stands to reason that if you wanted compatibility in engineering and science with them, you would adopt their units. The 1824 Weights and Measures Act in the Uk wiped the slate clean for measurement systems and established imperial units, so why not base things off of them? 3. Religion. Seriously. In Ohio there was an organization that opposed adopting the metric system because they saw the French Revolution as atheistic. Apparently, the state has been crazy for a very long time. I'm sure there were other reasons behind the US Customary system, so please feel free to tell me in the comments. However, that still begs the question  Why doesn't the US Switch to Metric? I mean, basically every other country on earth has done it. Even the US is slowly inching towards such a reform with the Metric Conversion Act I am also in favor of such a change. However, do seem to be a few reasons for opposition 1. The US is a big place, and it would be incredibly expensive to replace all the signage on the highway system to be metric in a short timeframe. 2. The hybrid system is basically fine already. The disaster with the Mars Climate Orbiter was just a mistake, and coexistence generally works out. 3. The Metric System might not be better than Customary for all use cases. This article notes that customary has units that fit human scale, like a cup of liquid that you would actually drink in one sitting, and the foot which metric has no defined equivalent. In this sense, customary might be more intuitive and better in certain areas such as woodworking. Again, if you have other reasons to support the Customary system or are against a full conversion to metric, please put your reasons down in the comments. Now, here is my question Should the United States fully adopt the metric system? Why or why not? What would be the tradeoffs of doing so or not doing so? Thank you for your input in advance. x200B Footnotes 1US Customary Units are almost the same as the old British Imperial Units, but there are some slight differences. The biggest one is probably the US having different values for dry and liquid volumes, which are a bit different than the imperial equivalent. 2 Technically, the Metric System has existed since the French Revolution, while the SI standard was codified in 1960. SI is the modern form of the Metric System. 3 NASA blames itself, not Lockheed, for the error. They say that they should have made the necessary checks.","Metric is just as arbitrary as imperial, just uses 10s for their unit conversion. In America, we actually use both for different reasons. I'll tell you how warm it is outside with Fahrenheit, but will use Celsius when discussing electronics. I don't think we would gain anything by switching over completely to metric.","You arent wrong, but its best to use the most useful measurement to convey information. I firmly believe fahrenheit is better for weather temperatures because its a smaller scale than celsius so there is a wider range of values to report. 65 is very different from 70, while 18.3 and 21.1 dont hit the same way. That said, metric distances of cm, dm, m, and km are better than inches, feet, yards, and miles because they are so easily-convertible.",PoliticalDebate

Presuming everyone agrees that ideally, we should be working to curb our own racistprejudicebigoted nature to try to treat everyone justly. Presuming we recognize the historical journey the black community has made from slavery to now, and is still making toward a balanced peace in US society. In order to address a problem, you need to understand what is the problem. The best way to identify the scope and cause of a problem is to dispassionately examine the evidence. Organizations like BLM obscure the real issues being faced by black America today. Organizations like BLM, try to turn the success story of Black Americans into a story of white oppression. I'm going to be examining a few things here, including what is the problem, vs what we're being told is the problem. I will be talking about political bias, because it's me... and it's relevant. I will be talking about activists trying to control the dialogue by simply declaring some topics off limits. I will use only black spokespersons to completely avoid the that's just what white people say argument, fully aware that there will be accusations of bias despite the fact that they are black. There will be personal attacks against the speakers, not their arguments so much, that will seek to make them appear in a less favorable light so you'll dismiss what they say. Let's talk about what the problem actually is. Poverty is a problem in the black community. Interestingly enough  the poverty rate for naturalized blacks is 11.8 compared to 25.1 for native born blacks, suggesting race alone does not explain income disparity. Not all minorities have low incomes. Asian families have higher incomes than all other ethnic groups. For example, the 2005 median income of Asian families was 68,957 compared to the median income of white families of 59,124.115 Asians, however, report discrimination occurrences more frequently than blacks. Specifically, 31 of Asians reported employment discrimination compared to 26 of blacks in 2005.  From the  Wiki on poverty in the US Suggesting this isn't a race issue. Criminal activity is an issue. So is criminal victimhood. According to the FBI, African-Americans accounted for 55.9 of all homicide offenders in 2019, with whites 41.1, and OtherUnknown 3.0 in cases where the race was known. Among homicide victims in 2019 where the race was known, 54.7 were black or African-American, 42.3 were white, and 3.1 were of other races. 13 of the population makes up 54 of the victims of homicide. Here's another statistic, nearly 70 of black men and more than that for women, do NOT have a felony. Meaning all this crime isn't being caused by BLACK PEOPLE, but rather some black people. Further, while no one is saying that poverty doesn't play a role, it isn't the only deciding factor, as homicides, robberies, assaults and other various crimes are higher amongst affluent black people of a certain culture, than their peers. In 2015-19, the share of families headed by single parents was 75 among African American families, 59 among Hispanic families, 38 among white families and 20 among Asian families. So parenting is an issue. These family structures make it almost impossible for inherited wealth to be passed down from generation to generation. Drugs and gangs are also an issue in Black America. All of these are tied to identity and culture. The more a culture participates in society, the more they accept the rules and the goals of that society, the better in general they perform. Only Native Americans, who've still largely opted out of society altogether, perform more poorly than the Black community. Politicizing the issue allows for people to let their political biases circumvent any introspective critical analysis of the data they're being presented with and confirmation bias takes over. There's endless fact checking sites out there that are doing nothing more than political punditry, and a majority of media outlets have leftist leanings, but even without them, would be inclined to lead with the story that bleeds the most. This, coupled with the exponential ease by which we can tailor make our newsfeeds and social circles, allows us to live in a land completely divided from reality, allowing us to believe that these problems aren't so bad, or don't exist. This is a problem. What isn't the problem? Police bruatlity. Pretending racism is the biggest problem. getting rich off of white guilt The advocates want to control the conversation. They tell you that you can't compare feminism issues in the US or UK with those in the ME or Asia or Africa. They tell you that you can't compare poverty issues in the US or UK with those of south and central America. They tell you that you can't compare black on black crime, with police officer involved shootings. They try to remove context. 100 people sounds like a lot of people if we're just talking about a BBQ. If we compare 100 people to 330,000,000 people, contextually, it's a small number. So, when painting a picture that police officer involved shootings are the most horrible, dangerous, and biggest problem facing Black America today, it's inconvenient to bring up that it actually isn't. Context matters. The anger that's rising in Black people about BLM is justified. Police training is a problem, but everyone faces the consequence of untrained or poorly trained police officers. BLM is hurting because of 2 major elements. It's overblowing instances to try to manufacture the appearance of systemic police racism, which gives opponents ammunition to point out the glaring, and obvious problems with the argument. Also, it's detracting from the real issues. Money, time and effort are going into buying these women houses and paying for their shopping sprees, further dividing the police from the communities they seek to serve and inciting violence and this kind of useless stupidity against police. BLM is hurting everyone it supposedly is there to protect, and lining the pockets of the founders and their friends.",Again...Rap was my answer to your question.

A belief that society functions better when everyone cooperates and works together. Communism has the appearance of a leftist project as it seeks to eliminate class structure based on personal wealth passed down through the generations, creating a permanent and nearly impenetrable divide. However, it simply swaps one structure for another. 1 party rule creates no incentive for the government to be responsive to the needs of the population and creates instead the party leadership class and the peasants who have even fewer rights and personal autonomy living at the whim of a total authoritarian government. It also removes the key liberal value of consent to be ruled, as there is no mechanism by which consent can be withdrawn. You'll have the communist party, and you'll like it, or you won't like it and have it anyhow. In many ways, it is the rebirth of serfdom with a different paint job. Sure, some of the knights aka party leaders might take excellent care of their serfs, and others may be ruthless, but the serf has no say in the matter. We can see this practically in the world. Countries that implement a communist form of government may thrive for some time under ideological leadership driven by a love of the people in Greek political theory, this is the benevolent dictator. Still, eventually and inevitably, the party leadership calcifies into a class structure. What is left is just a dictatorship with a serf-like labor force distributed among lieutenants who serve the dictator as party leaders.

I believe it ends up in achieving a government that meets what some right-wing individuals see as an ideal given enough time a.k.a. see Russia today but not through a path that I suspect any right-leaning individual would find acceptable.

18dakis,kcfyzae,kcie0cs,"Discussions Some places have cities that are walkable where there are mom and pop stores that provide a variety of products and services, meat markets, bakery's, small grocery, fresh vegetables and many many other things, and they are in walking proximity to homes and apartments.  We neglected to improve those an add the technology for improved security, with lighting camera's and police that walk a beat. Now we build subdivisions and gated communities that are not in walking distance to shops, and stores, and the reliance on big box supermarkets and other such things, are designed for drive up traffic. People claim to like the small town vibe, but that can exist within various city communities even within major metro's. It's probably more common on the East Coast than many other places. BUT. There are small town across America that can be rebuild, which have housing close to small shops and small stores. I think the challenge is the older people who live in some of these towns, fight against new things coming, and building apartments, and houses that can revive these towns. I think with the high cost housing, high vehicles cost and high vehicle insurance in Major cities, the younger generations may take move and begin to rebuild and remodel some of these towns that need to be rebuilt, and they can add in living spaces to make it walkable as a pedestrian friendly town, especially as the older people continue to age to the point they either stop fighting or can no longer fight against the younger generations ideas on how to revive these towns. I think crime can be reduced dramatically because they can use knowledge gained from the study of crime prevention and its can be applied in these areas, far better than trying to apply it across the whole of a major metro, with so many cities that might not want to support the ideas. but who knows, city by city within major metro's may well support it. We don't have cities like in S.E. Asia where people ride moped, to shopping and also walk to a variety of shops, they can walk to areas with street vendors and also to various types of entertainments. Maybe we should learn from some of them, because they did not all destroy their old models. I enjoyed time in places in S.E. Asia where I could walk, shop, walk to entertainment, walk to nice green spaces, and I could do it whether it was morning, evening, or night. x200B Maybe if we start converting more tall building into living spaces, it can reinvigorate some cities, especially in various parts of the country in various states. But, we must do it with improved security, which is lighting, camera's and areas where police can walk a beat, or ride in side by side units, and even do bicycle patrol when the weather permits. I know cities that desperately need it, because it was not build with enough public parking to revitalize the commercial establishments, so no one opens businesses in the store fronts, because customers don't come because there's no available parking. We even built some shopping areas with a lot of Big Box stores, but no design to comfortable walking spaces to navigates, only large parking lots, so people drive from one store to the next and then drive across the streets and do the same thing, drive from one store to the next. These facilities could have been built with walking spaces with greenery, rest benches and etc... to make it pedestrian friendly. With so much internet shopping, and delivery, we don't really need a lot of giant malls. that's been evident for the past 20 yrs as many have closed. x200B x200B","Large scale real estate projects and zoning are probably the key culprits.

183y8h3,katef1f,kaucm1m,"Buying vs Renting Articles are written discussing the cost differences as it relates to now. Buying and renting are so much more expensive now  but one is still cheaper almost everywhere I think it depends on where one is living as to the dynamics that play into choice. Maybe for the short term renting may be less costly, but Interest rates cannot remain high, and the sales prices cannot continue on the wild upwards trajectory it has been. At some point there will have to be some better regulation placed on Appraisers. Higher cost housing has built in issues, which relate to wages. If wages stagnate and prices are higher, even if a person buys, they will meet challenge with upkeep and maintenance expenses. I think States, Counties and Parishes and Cities are learning more of the negative effects of market pricing of homes, because during the early 2000's when property spiked up, it did not trigger a property tax increase to the level it needed to provide the levels of services being requested. Challenges Cities faced demand for more public services the more they paid for the homes, and in some localities that mean diverting public funds to these areas which became a detriment to lesser costly property areas.  City Councils and Counties and Parishes are struggling with this issue today, as challenges mount, and people come to both council and county and parish meetings, complaining about the declining services in areas of moderate priced housing.  The cost of services has increased in both materials and other elements necessary to provide servicing maintenance. Ordinance are being improved, which require better infrastructure and updates to older infrastructure.  Every city in the country in existing areas especially where communities with older homes and older commercial establishments, are requiring upgrades to water and sewer system, water treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants. Many cities these systems are well above 50 yrs in age. Renting is more short term design than homeownership. IF people rent and save with intent to purchase, in the long term they will be in a better position as they age to be a homeowner, especially by locking in a fixed rate mortgage. Even in this period with high interest rates, it is an advantage to buying, because as rates decrease, people can refinance for a lower rate. I think we will need another HAMP Home Affordable Mortgage Program style programs, Various Cities are increasing in number of those who fight against corporate buying of homes and creating an unsustainable rental rate hike. Corporate buying of homes, create community instability because renters are not stake holders in the community, and corporate owned homes become more transient occupied. The same is happening where people are fighting back against Airbnb rentals in their communities. Other Factors 1. As new business is being created in areas that currently have lower home prices and lower rental rates, and people looking to create various new start up business are doing so in areas that are experiencing redevelopment and areas where new communities are being developed. 2. Those younger people who look outward with a 10 yr vision and do their research, can buy land in areas where proposed development is being reviewed or approved and expansion development has began. 3. Many high-rise in various cities, are starting to reclaim vacant building and creating housing, especially in medium and larger metro's. Cities with population from 200K-400k are likely going to outpace some areas, because people can get housing in city commercialized areas and many of those see an increase in pedestrian traffic when more people buy in those converted high-rises, which lends itself to a reinvigoration of business in many of the empty store fronts. x200B x200B","I responded initially to your sub-comment, but primarily to the upper idea of the de-commodification and communization of both housing and land.

Does this explanation have credibility? Are there any other avenues in which Trump's plan could hypothetically happened with or without Mexico's support? ,"It's not impossible for him to do so, but the constitutionality of some parts would be questionable if he does it alone.

mvmz9y,gvdm2qx,gvdmsuv,How would this effect the Republican and democratic parties platforms. Would America not see a Republican president for a while if not ever. Would more political parties rise up and have a real shot at the presidency?,"I think the idea that blue urban areas would overpower Republicans is largely a myth. There are lots of Republicans in places like California, upstate New York, all of Ohio besides the greater Cleveland-Akron area.

These Republicans have zero practical influence now but would come into play without the electoral college. Youd still have situations like Pennsylvania, Virginia, and now Georgia, where even if one side tends to win for a bit, its still very close, with lots of voters on the other side.

xfl463,ior1066,iorabni,I'm an Indian and there has been a debate about whether we should replace our parliamentary form of government with a presidential form with a directly elected head. The most common argument against it has been the over-centralization of power in one individual. I am curious as to what the American populace thinks of it and how well has it fared for you.,"I don't particularly care for parliamentary government because of its nasty tendency to collapse, especially when the margins are tight. Currently, our House of Representatives has 221 Democrats and 212 Republicans, with two vacancies, which is the slimmest majority a party has had in decades. The Democratic Party is, in our terms, a Big Tent party, which means it has a very broad ideological spectrum. There are social democrats in the same party as some pretty right wing people, which can cause a lot of problems. If we had a parliamentary system, only six conservative Democrats could announce they were pulling support from Speaker Pelosi, and then she would be forced from office, possibly causing a snap election. There's also the fact that I don't care for indirectly-elected leadership, which is what a Prime Minister is. Presidents of parliamentary republics are weak executives, figureheads who just sign laws without exercising much real authority. The power lies in the Prime Minister, who is themselves usually chosen by party elites. Case in point, Liz Truss, the UK's new PM, was given her position by a leadership election of some 180,000 dues paying members of the Conservative Party, and now she governs the other 67,000,000 people who had no say in the matter. In fact, the parties and their lists have too much power in general under the parliamentary system, in my opinion. There are serious problems with the strong executive presidency, of course. There's too much legal shielding for presidents, and the bureaucracy of the executive branch has gotten a bit too large with the legislature mostly content to leave policy in the hands of executive orders which can easily be undone by the next president when they take office. That said, I like the stability and continuity that our system provides. Elections are neatly timed, coalitions mostly hold for the duration of each Congress, and I have a direct say in who actually governs me. I think I'd like to stick with it.","There's also the fact that I don't care for indirectly-elected leadership, which is what a Prime Minister is.

I looked up statistics on automobile deaths over the years. Assuming it was otherwise an average month for that year, more Americans died in car crashes than terrorist attacks in September of 2001. In terms of raw lives lost or saved, improvements to automobile safety standards over the last fifteen years have been far more important than the war on terror. The magnitude of our reaction to terrorism is driven by emotion, not reason. The entire strategy behind terrorism is to get us to over-react to it. This isn't subtle it's right there in the name.

Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success, Manafort has been noted as one of the few figures attempting to moderate Trump by focusing more on policy and attacking Clinton and weakening some of his hardest positions after Lewandowski's let Trump be Trump strategy. Manafort has also been embroiled in a growing scandal in his connections with Yanukovich, specifically charges that he legally and possibly illegally accepted large sums of money from the former Ukrainian government in exchange for pro-Yanukovich lobbying in Washington. Was the resignation an attempt to keep Manafort's personal scandals from affecting the campaign, or does it indicate Manafort's resignation to the belief that he can no longer control Trump? Was this a voluntary choice by Manafort as the statement suggests, or was he forced out? ","It's hard to say for sure what it means.

Their rating system runs Safe Biden, Likely Biden, Lean Biden, Toss Up, Lean Trump, Likely Trump, Safe Trump. Based on polling, and 538 agrees on this point, Florida is either a Toss-up or Lean Biden. Biden has led in the large majority of Florida polls, and if you shed some of the very low quality pollsters he's ahead in the large majority of polls. However! He's been leading on average by anywhere from 1 to 5 points. So, a very modest lead, i.e. either Lean Biden or Toss-up. CB has, instead, rated Florida as Lean Trump. Odd. Ok, Georgia is up next. It's a traditionally red state, polls showed Trump ahead there for most of the year, BUT there have been several polls of the race over the past few weeks that have shown a shift from Georgia being Lean Trump to maybe a Toss-up. There have even been a few polls that show Biden very slightly ahead in Georgia! By 1-3 points. A logical rating for Georgia would probably be either Lean Trump or Toss-up. Maybe, MAYBE, Lean Biden, though given that Georgia is still a pretty red state and that its only been the last couple weeks where polls have shown the race hovering a around a tie I would think Toss-up makes more sense. CB rated it Lean Biden. I'm confused by a world in which Florida could be rated as Lean Trump while Georgia is rated Lean Biden. Literally, based on polls  historical voting patterns.

3iadlv,cuepj4j,cuepmt8,"Puerto Rico is in a financial wreck at the moment, but even without that burden many people have questioned whether a bill to have Puerto Rico turned into a state could even so much as leave the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs to which the bills about Puerto Rican statehood get referred, let alone leave that committee and get put up for a vote before the Republican-dominated Congress. It's not the fault of the specific party, it's simply how political parties operate in general Puerto Rico would probably be a blue state, and political parties generally don't vote in favor of things that would make them lose power. I've begun to wonder recently, though, if Puerto Rican statehood could be made more likely from a political standpoint if it were made more bipartisan. How so? Well, one solution is to handle this the way we did during the most divisive time in US history by simultaneously going through the statehood process with another state that would politically counteract it. This is where the Mariana Islands come in. First, some background, including a history lesson The Mariana Islands are an island chain that is politically split into two territories Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. These two territories used to be a single colony under Spain until the US took Guam as spoils of the Spanish-American War and gave the rest of the islands now the Northern Marianas to Germany who didn't even fight in the war, the US simply did so because they heard Germany was negotiating with Spain for those islands by the time the US won that war. The Northern Marianas changed hands repeatedly before becoming a US territory. Some referendums were had during the 1960's or so to see if the islands wanted reunification, but Guam refused for reasons that are, in my opinion, no longer really politically relevant allegations that the Northern Marianas were spying or working with the Japanese during World War II, or fears that they would receive higher taxes, which I believe nowadays has been guaranteed will not happen to them if they enter political union, via 48 U.S.C. 1844 Economically, the Northern Marianas and Guam both rely on Japanese tourism and the US military for much of their economy. Both of these could be streamlined and improved by reunifying into a single territory or commonwealth, and 48 U.S.C. 1844 effectively guarantees them the best of both worlds should they reunify this means, for example, that Guam could fall under the CNMI Covenant, which the population prefers the idea of over Guam's Organic Act. The tourism industry in particular could benefit from statehood, given that it would increase the awareness of the islands in the mainland US. Politically, a reunified Marianas territory or commonwealth turning into a state would make for a PERFECT senatorial counterbalance to Puerto Rico becoming a state, because Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands both have a strong history of voting for the Republican party, and, in the case of the Northern Mariana Islands, the leading opposing party to the Republicans aren't democrats, but rather a different conservative party. The Mariana Islands are as red as Puerto Rico is blue, and it is because of this idea that I've led myself to believe that having binding statehood referendums for both if reunification happens of the commonwealths could lead to a statehood bill getting bipartisan support, and debates that don't simply come down to which party would get a Senate advantage.

In an insurgent war when it's hard to identify someone as an actual combatant and most of the time you can't, because guess what the guys that where shooting at you and you kill them what identifies them as enemy? They have nothing that would identify them as the enemy except for their rifles, and every person in that country has a rifle so that casualty goes on the civilian tracker even though not 10 minutes ago they were trying to kill you.

I tried to visit him a few months ago, but the prison denied my request, saying that they had changed their policy. Only his immediate family is allowed to see him now. This letter is the first contact I've had with him since we used to hang out downtown with our friends and drink coffee, smoke hand-rolled cigarettes, and talk about philosophy and politics. He is asking for support at a protest against human rights violations this Saturday. If anyone else cares to join, it is outside the Sussex I State Prison in Waverly, VA. Here is the letter edited and pics removed, sorry folks.      Dear ltme, As you probably already assumed, I'm not doing very well. In another letter I will tell you about the ridiculous circumstances that put me here. This letter is about a few things that makes this death camp one of the most vile places on Earth. Where Death Row prisoners are being housed used to be the Hole. The prisoners who previously occupied these cells threw feces, urine and vomit into the air-vents. These airducts have yet to be cleaned. To save money on heating and cooling, the air in this building is overly recirculated. This means, of course, more carbon dioxide and less oxygen. Worst of all, they will turn the air flow down so much that we often cannot feel any air coming out of our vents for months at a time. Because of all this, we are suffering Hypoxic Hypoxia. All of us prisoners are lethargic and couldn't exercise even if we had the space to do so. We all have short term memory loss and trouble concentrating. It is probable that we are all suffering at least mild brain damage. Disease is running rampant here. It takes a lot of effort for prisoners to protect themselves even though it is one of the easiest things for the prison to control. Rather, it should be easily controlled but these places are ran but people devoid of empathy and compassion. This place is never properly cleaned. There is thick black grime lining the bottom edge of every wall. On several occasions, raw sewerage has overflowed from drainage pipes and flooded into our cells. Every time this happened, the guards took several hours to bring us only spray cleaner and paper towels to clean up the mess. We have to share the same nail clipper. The same filthy nail clipper has to be passed from one person to the next, even to prisoners that have Hep-C and AIDS. The toilets in our cells can only be flushed once every five minutes. If you even accidentally touch the flush button more than once in a five minute time period then the toilet will shut off for one hour. Our drinking water is a fairly thick yellow-brown color. I have no fucking idea what's in it but I'm sure it cannot be good. For breakfast today we were served grits, pancakes, potatoes and maple flavored corn syrup. We will go for days without getting a single piece of fruit. We never get enough protein. Malnourishment and oxygen deprivation is causing our bodies to grow old very rapidly. Prisoners not even thirty years old are going gray and losing hair. We have bone joint and muscle problems. We have lines in our faces that young people should not have. My body is so broken down, especially my mind. You would think that the medical treatment here was something out of a horror film. The dentists here have performed oral surgeries without using anesthetics. A dentist accidentally stitched one prisoner's cheek to his gum and ripped out half of another prisoner's tooth. The doctors here seem to have an adversity to treating people's illnesses but love dishing out painkillers and sleeping pills. I don't think you know this about me, and I'm sorry that I have to explain it to you, but I have severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Without proper treatment I get lesions and regular diarrhea. The diarrhea removes my probiotic flora which leaves the lesions susceptible to infection. The doctor refuses to let me take over-the-counter Acidophilus supplements. At the first jail, I beat up a man who tried to assault me. The police did not like that very much because the man I beat up was one of their snitches, so they chained me up and threw me face first into the cement floor. This dislocated my jaw and now I can only chew with one side of my mouth and my jaw now grinds against my skull which causes me to have a constant headache. The doctor here tried to put me on pain killers but I refused. For recreation we get to go into separate cages for about an hour, five times a week. I have not been able to run for several years. Everywhere else in the world allows prisoners to have conjugal visits except here. So it is alright for guards to sexually harass prisoners but not for prisoners to have sex with their wives. Then they took away contact visits where we could sit with and hug our family and friends. Instead we were locked into booths with our visitors sitting on the other side of a Plexiglas window. But that was clearly not enough dehumanization because now we can only see our visitors through a television screen. For passover, the prison refused to serve me kosher food so far that whole week I ate nothing. I'm not exactly religious but my father was a Holocaust survivor so some Hebrew rituals are important for me. The prison chaplain mocked passover and later told one of the guards that Jews are a bunch of Christ-killers. I should probably explain to the chaplain that I am only half Jewish so I'm really only half a Christ-killer. I really only threatened Jesus and smacked him around a little. There are countless publications that we are not allowed to read. Many of these books and magazines are about political and social reform. Many religious books are banned. We can't have almost anything with erotic content. We can't receive nude photos through the mail. I have not had sex for five fucking years it's punny and I can't see a photo of a girlfriend. All jails and prisons in the U.S. conduct in activity that the world court condemns as torture. Guards will shock people with electricity, strap naked prisoners to a chair and hose them down with ice cold water, spray C-S gas and pepper spray into the faces of chained prisoners, deprive people of sleep, and deny medicine that treats painful illnesses. According to the U.S. Constitution we are slaves and have no civil rights. That's why our torture is legal. Me and several prisoners are asking our friends and anyone who cares to rally outside this death camp on Sept. 4, at 300pm, to protest the human rights violations that are conducted here. I know it is very short notice but I really need your help. Your friend, ltname removed to protect privacy""","""I have NEVER been able to wrap my mind around the idea of treating prisoners like motel guests. Especially with the ones we intend to kill. Gotta be sure that the needle being used to give them a lethal injection is clean! They're prisoners. What happened to throwing them in the dungeon and forgetting about them until execution day? Don't break the rules and it's usually not a problem. Yes sometimes circumstances suck and you get the short end of the stick. That's reality. This is the system that we have created and accepted.

The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information press, radio, education. It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights. - Albert Einstein, Why Socialism? I'm adding this in here as something of a prewarning for why the media will attempt to distort this crackdown into something that is not a brutal and flagrant violation of free expression.

It is capitalism under duress by those who don't quite see capital honest savings and serving the needs of customers as the only means of getting ahead. True capitalists are our friends, and who you call the 1 are the corporatists - corporate fascists, not capitalists.

The fact that the reich wing have now developed a strategy to begin screaming about government spending is why you should be worried. It signals a more sinister turn in austerity and the end of government for the people. Keynsian stimulation was the grease that made the 20th century go round and worked very well.

""","""Republicans despise the Clintons and are notorious for running brutally nasty campaigns when they see an opening. Remember W accusing John Kerry of lying about being a war hero and John McCain of having a secret black baby. The Obama campaign had to deal with birthers and accusations of consorting with terrorists. Reagan planted rumors that Dukakis was seriously ill because he was little and dorky looking. A lot of the Bill Clinton sex scandal stuff would have stuck better coming from a candidate that was not clearly a hypocrite. They certainly would been more disciplined about leaking that stuff out through back channels and surrogates and given Hillary less to work with, so I doubt the Dems would have been as strong on the negative attacks. Trump was a pretty easy target.""","""politics"""

The 99 is begining to wake up, please don't fall back asleep as the American Dream can only be relized when people are awake.""","""Let me just chime in here. There is a concerted effort at this time to brand the OWS movement as disorganized, as fringe radicals, as angry and entitled and many other negative things. If you pay attention, all the major media channels are echoing the same sentiments. This does not happen by accident. PR firms are consulted to craft a message and help figure out what phrases and images help to marginalize a movement that threatens the status quo. There are image management companies, quite large ones, that post in comments, newsgroups and aggregator sites like reddit to create an appearance of a much larger opposition to the movement than really exists. The inverse happened with the Tea Party they made them seem much more respectable, organized and numerous than they really were to push a hyperconservative agenda. Fortunately, the OWS represents the feelings of so many Americans that, despite heavy pushback and low media coverage, we are still forcing the message to get out to the average person. Also, since younger and the most politically active Americans now are more likely to get their news from the Internet, they are less likely to get the poisoned message that broadcast media is pushing. To combat this, image management goons and PR flaks are coming out in droves to try and roadblock the movement. They can no longer stop it, but they are trying to slow it down and keep it as small as possible. If that fails, they will try and co-opt the message expect that to start soon. Make no mistake, this is a very concerning movement for the powers that be. It is the voice of the people, and they have probably been fearing the blowback from screwing us over for some time. Keep pushing forward, and don't forget that you can be the person that informs others about OWS and what it means. There's still a lot of people that are not familiar with the movement take the opportunity to talk to your friends about it and educate them. It means a lot to get ahead of the crafted media message, which is clearly designed to fracture and demoralize the protestors and those who would support them.""","""...now where did that foil hat go...""","""politics"""
"""844y81""","""dvo542w""","""dvo5aa1""","""Introduction Today, voters in Pennsylvania's current 18th district head to the polls to elect a new Congressman. The 18th district was vacated in October of last year by then-Rep. Tim Murphy, who had represented the district since 2003, as a result of allegations of sexual harassment and that he had purportedly pressured his lover to abort her pregnancy. Public polling suggests a tight race. In 2016, President Trump won this district by 20 pts over Hillary Clinton, and Mitt Romney beat President Obama by a similar margin in 2012. However, the district sports a 6 pt Democratic registration advantage, and a slew of recent polls have shown narrow leads for Democrat Conor Lamb, while Republican internal polling has shown Republican Rick Saccone receiving late-breaking momentum as a result of a rally with the President on Saturday. Total spending in the race has reached in excess of 11million much of it in support of Saccone however, as a result of FEC rules, ad purchases by campaigns directly receive preferential rates, and so the total disparity between the candidates is less asymmetrical. The winner of the contest will become Pennsylvania's 18th district's Congressman, but that district may not be around for much longer. In February, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state's Congressional maps as a partisan gerrymander in violation of the state constitution's equal protection clause. An appeal to this decision is pending before the US Supreme Court on a theory of violating the Elections Clause of the federal Constitution, but should a stay be denied, the existing configuration of the state's districts will be thrown out for the elections in November later this year. As a note to users looking for more information on this district, maps on Wikipedia have been updated, and the current 18th district is now largely split between the new 14th and 17th districts.
