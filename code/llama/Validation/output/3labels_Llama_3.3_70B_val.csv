You get a certain level of support, negotiate and compromise with others to get what you want. It's basically the same here in Canada, only we have a party called the NDP that you could think of a party for people like Bernie and AOC. Then we have the Liberal Party which is the center-left party. Many decades ago the NDP was pushing for universal healthcare, the Liberals saw that was popular and decided they'd do it. Was this the political class recognizing that something would move support away from the third party back to them? Yeah maybe you could look at it that way. Does it matter? No, because we got healthcare and that's what's important. I think it's a bit odd that Americans seem to think that making compromises is a bad thing and something to be suspicious of. It's how democracy is supposed to work. I mean are you supposed to never change and always stay with policies even if they've been proven not to work and nobody wants them? Or are you supposed to recognize that something you believed in before isn't working, and recognize that the people of your country want something else? Is it bad that Biden recognizes that a lot of people are supporting Bernie because they like his ideas?

comment: 'the grievances are, definitely, legitimate. minority groups are much more likely to be charged with and convicted of crimes, and their sentences are often longer compared to white convicts. source i know the aclu isn't exactly unbiased, but i at least trust their fact-checking. the methods of their protests, however, tend to be poorly received by the public, and i think that has a number of factors. in many recent stories, people under the banner of the blm movement have gone beyond marches and demonstrations, and have actively tried to disrupt large events in an effort to sort of steal the spotlight. examples 1 2 3 in theory, there's no such thing as bad publicity, so this should work. in practice, i feel they often end up going too far. blocking train lines and freeways, interrupting political meetings, and the like all end up conveying a sense of antagonism, which creates a dissonance when they turn around and say they're fighting for equality. this kind of points to another fairly large problem- lack of unity. blm started off as a protest group centered around stopping racism in police forces, largely in response to the ferguson and baltimore uproars in the past year. that was an easily defined purpose, and it aligned blm clearly against 'the bad guys'. obviously the people who are protesting police racism are the good guys, right? easy-to-digest, and hard to make them look bad. but since then, their 'purpose' has kind of evolved into a general fight against all forms of economicsocialpolitical racism, which is much harder to define, makes it harder to measure progress, and gives the image of a disorganized mob rather than a passionate crowd. it has a lot of parallels with the 99 rallies, actually. sure, there's a general feeling across it all racism now, economic injustice then but they seem to be lacking a sense of consistency, of unity.' ; reply:'minority groups are much more likely to be charged with and convicted of crimes this is not a legitimate grievance if they are actually committing more crimes.  and their sentences are often longer compared to white convicts. this a legitimate grievance.
