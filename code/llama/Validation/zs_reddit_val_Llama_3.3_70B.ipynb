It\\'s hard to explain, because things have changed so much. It\\'s hard to explain how weird the word Homeland sounds in the ear of a pre-911 American. I can only say that it\\'s not an American word. It\\'s an Old World word. It\\'s a medieval word, a communist word, a Nazi word. It\\'s a word used by people who identify themselves as an ethnicity, a tribe. It\\'s not a word used by a people who identify themselves in terms of a philosophy based on universal ideals. I wish I were more eloquent. I wish I could explain. So much has changed. It\\'s a word used by a besieged, defensive and frightened people not a word used by a confident, optimistic, powerful people. It\\'s a word for serfs. Things change and being old means you see the sweep of it, and you see the younger people born into it and not realizing that things used to be different. You look around and say to yourself, This is not America, but it is. It isn\\'t the America you remember, but the passage of time makes that your personal problem, a problem of personal history. And even if I could tell you why it feels fundamentally wrong to live in an America with an official Department of Homeland Security I don\\'t see how it would matter. It\\'s your America now.\\' ; reply: \\'Nailed it. It\\'s a creepy, obvious propaganda word. We used to make fun of the other guys for being so obvious with their loyalty language. Comrade.
