0,0,0,0.0,0.0,7b7akb,dpg5ax6,dpg8aw5,"As there is an ongoing rhetoric about fake news I recently thought of the former Fairness Doctrine in the US and if it should be put back in place.  The Fairness Doctrine was a policy of the United States Federal Communications Commission FCC, introduced in 1949, that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that wasin the Commission's viewhonest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987 and removed the rule that implemented the policy from the Federal Register in August 2011.  What would the benefits and costs be if the FCC  US were to establish this rule for media companies once again? Would or could this possibly address the issues at hand?   ","I don't advocate regulating internet speech, but the fairness doctrine has no benefit in the world of internet focused media without that aspect. Worth starting here  Because obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment, it is prohibited on cable, satellite and broadcast TV and radio. However, the same rules for indecency and profanity do not apply to cable, satellite TV and satellite radio because they are subscription services. The FCC does not regulate internet speech, or that of Satellite broadcasts. The costs incurred would be incredibly high to regulate, and even higher to enforce, maybe even impossible. The fairness doctrine was established in 1949, and served it's purpose when communication was expensive, and people were only listening on radio  TV - something that anyone w a transmitter has the ability to broadcast to. It's no longer relevant in the internet age - or at least no longer enforceable. This would require 100 of the websites on the internet to be examined on an ongoing basis, scanned for all the same rules that apply as broadcast television, and regulated accordingly. Completely ignoring the political implications of such a clamp down, there are 300 hours of video added to YouTube per minute that would need to be screened for fairness, not including every post that was added to Facebook. Google can't keep up with it at the pace something spreads virally, I have no confidence that a public endeavor could do better. I'm not even sure how YouTube alone could be handled, ignoring every other site on the internet. That would mean 300 60  18,000 people listening and determining if 1 there's a political bias 2 whether there's an opposite viewpoint. The other side of this would be hardware logistics required for enforcement. Every ISP would then need to be able to segment traffic based on location - the internet is inherently an international commodity, with some big caveats  China blocking major search hubs for example. A system would need to be devised for availability of traffic based on an agreed upon algorithm in relation to fairness in real time. Billions in infrastructure changes? Trillions? There would also be a huge shakeup in the cost of doing business on the internet as well as how startups work, grow, and thrive in that environment. Do adult sites get a pass? Does that mean that a blogger has to post 50 of their content as an opposing view? Many many unanswered questions. Costs very high. Benefit is cloudy. I'm not sure it's even possible to enforce without full violation of several amendments. ","What if you only applied it to larger journalistic groups? Joe Schmoe and his Daily Youtube Show probably isn't worth regulating to begin with, but larger organizations that bring in a lot of traffic Say, Breitbart or Mother Jones, for instance, as well as traditional news organizations are a much clearer target for enforcement. As long as you define a clear qualifier for being a major news media outlet, enforcement should still be viable.",NeutralPolitics,D

The left has virtually no meaningful presence within the Democratic party today. I've been an activist for years, when I was younger I worked on several campaigns with Democratic organizers, and even back then the Democrats had absolutely no time for the left as a whole.

There was no effort made to specifically place LGBTQ people in positions where they might be interacting with the community that this mandate was put in place with a mind towards.

10,10,10,,,bkafep,emf6sht,emfv0d2,"Barr's statement We accepted the statements in the report as the actual record. We did not go underneath it to see whether or not they were accurate. We accepted it as accurate, Barr said Wednesday while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Source I fell like some of them are misunderstanding the 'underlying evidence' part. He didn't dig deep to find out whether Mueller's statements were true or not. He just accepted the Mueller report as it is. For eg. kamala Harris asked Barr if he had reviewed all the underlying evidence that special counsel Robert Mueller had compiled in order to draw his conclusions. Barr indicated that he hadnt, and noted that he simply took Muellers written report as the evidence itself, determining that Trump had not obstructed justice after reading it. So it seems like he just read the Wikipedia article the Mueller report in this case and not the sources. He just accepted the Mueller report as it is. He said that this approach is a standard practice in which officials at the Department of Justice DOJ often rely on the characterization of the evidence uncovered in an investigation. I think there are other more important issues with Barr that need to focussed on. Concerns within the special counsel's office were not just about the accuracy of Barr's summaries, but in how adequately he had portrayed the work of the special counsel. And he lied to the congress. Am i missing something here?","If the Special Counsel found evidence that was supportive of an indictment they would have issued it. Barr said as much. He said Mueller stated multiple times that the decision was made not to bring charges based on the evidence and not on anything else and that if there had been they would have. So if Mueller didnt bring charges why should Barr overrule his teams decisions? What does it matter whether anyone feels he mischaracterized the report in his summary letter? Thats how some people feel, and thats fine, but thats a moot point. They only feel that way because they now have the full report and find it characterizes it differently. Thats an opinion they have. Other people like myself dont have that opinion. None of that affects the outcome of the actual report which is actually available now and actually says no collusion, not enough evidence to prove obstruction. Why is this so hard to understand? If the report had been modified by the AG then that would be a different conversation. Surely if that was the case someone in Mueller team would have said they changed the report! They havent. Whats the issue here?",the decision was made not to bring charges based on the evidence That's not true. Mueller said he didn't bring charges because of DoJ policy not to against a siting president. Not because of evidence. The report is overflowing with all the evidence necessary to convict on multiple counts. Your take is a misinterpretation.,Askpolitics,A

Read Pre.1 Overview of the Preamble  Pre.2 Historical Background on the Preamble   Pre.3 Legal Effect of the Preamble   The Preambles origins predate the Constitutional Convention  The tradition of a legal preamble continued in the New World. The Declarations and Resolves of the First Continental Congress in 1774 included a preamble noting the many grievances the thirteen colonies held against British rule.  5 Building on this document, in perhaps the only preamble that rivals the fame of the Constitutions opening lines, the Declaration of Independence of 1776 announced We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  The initial draft of the Constitutions Preamble was, however, fairly brief and did not specify the Constitutions objectives. As released by the Committee of Detail on August 6, 1787, this draft stated We the People of the States of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, do ordain, declare and establish the following Constitution for the Government of Ourselves and our Posterity.  13 While this draft was passed unanimously by the delegates,  14 the Preamble underwent significant changes after the draft Constitution was referred to the Committee of Style on September 8, 1787. Perhaps with the understanding that the inclusion of all thirteen of the states in the Preamble was more precatory than realistic,  15 the Committee of Style, led by Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania,  16 replaced the opening phrase of the Constitution with the now-familiar introduction We, the People of the United States.  17 Moreover, the Preamble, as altered by Morris, listed six broad goals for the Constitution to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty -------------- ....... The Supreme Court subsequently endorsed Justice Storys view of the Preamble, holding in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that, while the Constitutions introductory paragraph indicates the general purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution. With regard to the legal effect of the Constitutions preface, in the early years of the Supreme Court, it did reference the Preambles words in some of the most important cases interpreting the Constitution. For example, in 1793, two Members of the Court cited the Preamble in Chisholm v. Georgia to argue that the people, in establishing the Constitution, necessarily subjected the State of Georgia to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in exchange for accomplishing the six broad goals listed in the Constitutions Preamble. x200B The Preamble appears to have had a more significant influence outside of judicial opinions in statements from the leaders of the political branches of government, often factoring in various debates during the early history of the nation. For instance, during the debates in the First Congress over the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States, congressional leaders, like Elbridge Gerry of the Massachusetts, quoted the Preamble to note the broad objects for which the Constitution was established and to justify the establishment of a national bank to promote the general welfare.14 And the Preamble featured in early congressional debates over the role of the new government in foreign affairs. For example, during the Tenth Congress, Henry Southard of New Jersey cited the Preamble in arguing in favor of Congress arming and equipping the militia of the United States, recognizing that it was the object of the establishment of the federal government to provide for the common defence against foreign enemies. 15 Perhaps one of the most famous references to the Preamble in the halls of Congress came in a speech of Senator Daniel Webster in the midst of the nullification debates of the 1830s, wherein he quoted the Preamble to argue that the Constitution was perpetual and immortal, establishing a union which shall last through all time. 16 While the Preamble may have had particular relevance to a number of isolated questions before the Congress in the Nations early years, Presidents and congressional leaders have more generally relied on the Preambles laudatory phrases in exploring the broader import of the Constitution and the general purposes of American government. For instance, President James Monroe referred to the Preamble as the Key of the Constitution, 17 and in his inaugural address, President John Quincy Adams described the first words of the Constitution as declaring the purposes for which the government should be invariably and sacredly devoted. 18 Echoing these themes in his own first inaugural address, President Abraham Lincoln invoked the Preambles perfect union language to note the importance of national unity as the country faced the brink of civil war. 19 In the midst of another constitutional crisisR12that which arose in 1937 amid clashes over the constitutionality of the New DealR12 President Franklin Roosevelt stated the need to read and reread the preamble of the Constitution, as its words suggested that the document could be used as an instrument of progress, and not as a device for prevention of action. 20 Decades later, Representative Barbara Jordan, the first African-American woman elected to the House of Representatives from the South, quoted the Preamble in a statement before the House Judiciary Committee as it considered the Articles of Impeachment for President Richard Nixon.21 In that statement, she noted that through the process of amendment, interpretation, and court decision she had been included in We, the people and was now serving as an inquisitor aiming to preserve the goals of the Constitution. x200B x200B",What is the debate here?,They are a Progressive of some shade and are saying as long as the ever centralizing and expanding federal government uses the six pillars of the Preamble in their arguments it will increase their political capital to make it happen.,PoliticalDebate,D

Now, President Trump has cost Republicans those tools, and the party will have to rebuild around new people and ideas.","This has been a theme on the left for a few decades now - the inevitable collapse of the Republican Party. But not only hasn't it occurred, the Democratic Party's constant attempts to re-write the rules in their favor strongly suggest it's not going to occur any time soon. Something you might consider is that the last three Democratic Presidents have all been elected in very unusual circumstances - a three-way race in 1992, an economic meltdown in 2008 and COVID-19 in 2020. Basically, the Democrats have been getting lucky... and they can't get lucky forever. The essential problem is that the Democratic coalition has crumbled.

They've got the cash-richvote-poor tech industry in their corner - if Ford Motors is on your side, so are thousands of autoworkers if Google is on your side, it just means a few hundred software engineers. Turchin has written on this phenomenon - the overproduction of elites - and if you accept his hypothesis, it's going to be a serious problem for the Democratic Party going forward because they're the elites being 'overproduced' and there's only so long they can hold onto decaying institutions without shifting their focus to form a more functional coalition. In contrast, all the Republicans have to do is point at the Democrats and say we're not those guys and they've got a functional coalition that will put them in power."," They've always had strength in culture, media and higher education but those institutions are slowly dying.

31,31,31,,,mtp296,gv1typg,gv1x4r5, I'm attempting to become more involved with politics at the dinner table. I thought I would stop by here to ask some of you what you think may be contributing to the division in the political world at this point in time. Thank you.," Is it? In a lot of ways, the world is more connected than it has ever been. It is easier for goods, people, and information to travel around the world than it has ever been. In a certain sense, the fact that we see such strong partisan division in so many different societies is actually evidence of these interconnections. Global politics is affecting domestic politics more than ever before. I think it is this new globalized environment that is at least playing a role in political conflict. More people can let their voices be heard. People who might not have found like-minded voices in their own communities or countries can find them around the world. This makes divisions that previously would have been overlooked far more visible. More importantly, many more actors can exert influence on many more people. Today's Martin Luther King's can reach more people with less effort than MLK ever could, but so can today's Hitler's. Another factor has to do with the global movement of people. In many countries, the sharpest divisions are either directly or indirectly, about migration, culture, ethnicity, and race. Brexit, Trump, Hijab bans. etc. Globalization has been moving people around for more than a century, and climate change will only make it happen more in the future. The global movement of goods has upset local economic systems and undermined traditional modes of production. This doesn't just cause economic harm. It also causes dramatic shifts in how cultures understand themselves. If we look historically, though, we might not actually be in such bad shape. We are 13 years past the largest global economic crisis in almost a century. 13 years after the previous one, we were in the middle of a World War.",I like this answer a lot. Thank you.,Askpolitics,D

Prior to the June 9th meeting the only information that was known was that the Russian nationals had claimed they had information that would incriminate Hillary Clinton.

Under 18 USC 1001 - Trump made a materially false document in order to cover up a matter of investigation in the Trump Tower response memo which his lawyers accidentally revealed to the NYS was dictated by Trump  Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully 1 falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact 2 makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation or 3 makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry 2. It also makes him an accessory to the Trump Tower meeting crime directly admitted to by Don Jr. and Kushner both of whom tweeted their own emails from the campaign. These emails were corroborated by Don Trump Jr. in a separate tweet. Both men have stated publicly that these tweets were real and from them.  In these tweeted images, Jr. states his intention and frame of mind plainly in the first image as, The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was political opposition research... I decided to take the meeting We now know that Kushner and Don Jr. believed the meeting to be about a thing of value, political opposition research. And made an attempt to meet. Which violates 52 USC 30121  a Prohibition It shall be unlawful for 2 a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation described in subparagraph A or B of paragraph 1 from a foreign national And as an addendum, it is well established that information can be a thing of value in an FEC context.

What's more, respondents with higher numeracy were actually more likely to be affected by their bias. So, if facts don't trump bias, even in those people best equipped to analyze the facts, what hope do we have of producing effective policies? And to get meta, what is the point of this subreddit?","I don't find this particularly disturbing and could even see myself getting it wrong in some situations due to my own bias. In the event it's pointed out to me, such as in neutral political discourse, it wouldn't be difficult to recognize my error. There is a more insidious side to bias. Many people will do all sorts of contortions to avoid recognizing their error. I go through these contortions myself before admitting an error. This is not always bad since the information needs vetted before accepting the correct answer as such but is often taken too far. Often times in real world data we have have valid data that provides valid truth values yet lack enough data to provide an unbiased answer. To claim a lack bias from the start is an absurdity. So I would say this is why discourse is needed, political or otherwise, in order to vet the bias that is an essential part of all of us. Neutrality only requires a willingness to cede errors in our bias. ","To add to what you said and expand on the article. When we see a data set that is contrary to our views we attempt to vet the information, when we see one that confirms our view we tend to accept it.

37,37,37,,,3v0fwa,cxj9x28,cxjv7jn,"Black Lives Matter began as a popular hashtag after the Trayvon Martin incident, and quickly became a national movement in the aftermath of incident at Ferguson. Although originally focused on killings of African-Americans by police across the nation, the movement's founder, Alicia Gray, has since acknowledged that the movement has evolved into a more widespread protest against societal and institutional violence that targets black individuals. The movement has quickly entered the national consciousness, with many referring to it as the new civil rights movement, and protestors using the group's slogans have staged major protests across the US in the last year. The movement has become so culturally pervasive that it has even been featured on a recent episode of Law and Order SVU. However, the movement has faced criticism for both its goals and its tactics. The movement has been accused of fabricating death counts and other statistics, while others worry that the movement promotes anti-white radicalism. Additionally, the movement has been criticized for its methods, with protests blocking roads and public spaces and interrupting or intruding on other causes and organizations Supporters of the movement counter that such tactics are necessary to draw attention to the issues faced by the African-American community. My question is how legitimate are the grievances of BLM? How bad is the problem of racial violence in the US, and are racial issues to blame for the protested social inequities, or are other factors at play? Are BLM's tactics appropriate, or do they go too far?","The grievances are, definitely, legitimate. Minority groups are much more likely to be charged with and convicted of crimes, and their sentences are often longer compared to white convicts. source I know the ACLU isn't exactly unbiased, but I at least trust their fact-checking. The methods of their protests, however, tend to be poorly received by the public, and I think that has a number of factors. In many recent stories, people under the banner of the BLM movement have gone beyond marches and demonstrations, and have actively tried to disrupt large events in an effort to sort of steal the spotlight. Examples 1 2 3 In theory, there's no such thing as bad publicity, so this should work. In practice, I feel they often end up going too far. Blocking train lines and freeways, interrupting political meetings, and the like all end up conveying a sense of antagonism, which creates a dissonance when they turn around and say they're fighting for equality. This kind of points to another fairly large problem- lack of unity. BLM started off as a protest group centered around stopping racism in police forces, largely in response to the Ferguson and Baltimore uproars in the past year. That was an easily defined purpose, and it aligned BLM clearly against 'the bad guys'. Obviously the people who are protesting police racism are the good guys, right? Easy-to-digest, and hard to make them look bad. But since then, their 'purpose' has kind of evolved into a general fight against all forms of economicsocialpolitical racism, which is much harder to define, makes it harder to measure progress, and gives the image of a disorganized mob rather than a passionate crowd. It has a lot of parallels with the 99 rallies, actually. Sure, there's a general feeling across it all racism now, economic injustice then but they seem to be lacking a sense of consistency, of unity.", Minority groups are much more likely to be charged with and convicted of crimes This is not a legitimate grievance if they are actually committing more crimes.  and their sentences are often longer compared to white convicts.

For these folks, it's not about policy because their policy is to have no policy. They don't want anything to change. America is already great. Always has been. So let's keep it that way. Therefore for those on the right, it's a contest of likability. Who can they see themselves having a beer with? as someone else wrote. On the left, it's a different story. Among individuals who lean left there is a greater emphasis on policy and change from the status quo. These are your progressives and liberals, including young whites with college education, non-whites of all backgrounds, LGBTQ, non-Christians, etc. This half of the country legitimately feels, and perhaps rightfully so, that policies at the State and Federal level not only do not work for them, but actively undermine their own pursuit of the American Dream.

50,50,50,,,174wiog,k4cd9vg,k4ce304,"I set out on a path to learn socialism and communism about 2-3 years ago, and it took about that much time to finally understand it. There's a lot of misinformation, disinformation, confusion, and ignorance on the subject from both Communists and everyone else. I have never seen anything so properly buried, trying to learn communism is like digging for the bones of a T Rex. Never in my life have I met someone who understands communism, and never have I run into anyone online who understand it other than some Communists themselves. The right wingers and the majority of western liberals look at it historically and think the USSR was communist because it was led by a Communist party. Same thing with China. But, if they would simply Google communism, they'd see the various requirements that the USSR did not even come close to meeting, like The requirement of a global socialists revolution as a precursor, becoming stateless, moneyless, and having a voluntary workforce. Most people think that because the Bolshevisks successfully revolutionized that they had achieved communism and communists support that authoritarian government, but that's not even close. If I had to explain it simply Communism is not simply and ideology, it is a structure for a NEW WORLD ORDER. Communism is a very specific thing, the absolute end of point of socialism having been established globally for years. The USSR was arguably not even socialist, 1000 not communist. If there was a stateless, moneyless, country with a voluntary workforce capitalist countries would imperialize immediately and destroy it. Communism is incompatible with a capitalist world and that is why it has never existed. Communists need a global revolution in order to have a chance to ever implement communism. Marxism-Leninism was the first method of taking steps towards it, after Russia they needed everyone else to revolutionize, but they didn't do they got stuck. Ive explained all this many times but it's difficult to learn. It takes years of studies, and a lot of reading. It's far from a simple concept. If you all are really interested in learning it, the sidebar has  and ","My answer to this is undoubtedly shaped by my own experience in engaging with communist thought, and my perspective as an anarchist communist, but I dont think its quite so simple or straightforward as that. You seem to talk of understanding communism as some ontologically-independent thing which is and can be understood as communism as-such I dont think this is the case at all. Communism cannot adequately be boiled down to the long-term establishment of such and such a world order. To do this ignores how much I would argue most of the communist tradition has rejected this definition on at least an implicit level in their rhetoric and praxis. Communism also cannot be entirely defined according to the Marxist tradition, because of non-Marxist communist thought like anarchist communism and the fact that Marx himself acknowledges in the Manifesto how communist discourse was taking place before he ever published a robust definition of the movement. In short, I dont think communism can really be understood as some single thing or idea that is to comprehended and judged as it is. Communism is far more akin to an intellectual tradition or school of thought, with great variance and diversity even in the presence of its mainstream expression of the Marxist tradition.","I think that what exactly it is is up for debate in terms of actual policy, like we have many capitalist countries but they're all very different in terms of how they govern.

Trade deals are a net positive for the U.S. consumer especially low-income families because they are affected the most by the drop in prices. And the benefit from trade deals is more wide-ranging then simply lower prices for consumers, We also see the advantage of having low-income high labor jobs being replaced by more higher paying work in factories.

Thank you!,"We can only do a comparison between the old divisions and new. First, historically in the private sector 1994-2014 study of polls indicated that division increased from 1994 to 2014. Pew Research a conservative think tank, found that the trends at that time manifested themselves in both, in politics and in everyday life. The survey of 10,000 adults nationwide finds that these divisions are greatest among those who are the most engaged and active in the political process. Back then 92 of Republicans are to the right of the median Democrat, and 94 of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican.  The more recent and more focused Pew research polls that studied attitudes regarding voting issues April 2021, similarly found a growing division between the American voting population. The share of Republicans who say any voter should be allowed to vote early or absentee without a documented reason has fallen 19 percentage points from 57 to 38. Democrats and Democratic leaners are far more supportive of automatically registering all eligible citizens to vote 82 and no-excuse early voting 84 their views are virtually unchanged in recent years. The new national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted from April 5-11, 2021, among 5,109 adults who are members of the Centers American Trends Panel, also finds wide partisan differences over removing inactive voters from voting registration lists. A 68 majority of Republicans favor removing people from voting registration lists if they have not recently voted or confirmed their registration, compared with just 27 of Democrats. Still, several proposals draw majority support from both Republicans and Democrats, including requiring electronic voting machines to print paper ballots as backups and for making early, in-person voting available for at least two weeks prior to Election Day.  It seems to me that the overall divisions that we see today tend to be more issue based and vary in support depending on the issue. There is, for instance, majority support for many of the Biden's big agendas it is different, however, when it comes to voting rights and division develops.
