Articul 12 the right to marry. unless that is, you marry a non European, in that case you can be treated like an Aryan marring a Jew The ECHR ruling was if they can live together outside of the EU, then entry can be refused for the non European. However the exception is of course if you are not bringing your non-European partner back to your own country because now you are a good European for living in another country The system is a pretence , i am glad to replace it.""
