c7m7a4z,c7ma64o,"A very good stance on gun control. However, I'd like to modify a few things that you stated and add a couple more points.

Assault Weapons: Assault weapons in terms used by the Democrat party are weapons that have the look and feel of a military style weapon. They are weapons that have a ""high capacity"" magazine. The problem with this is, if you are to regulate the amount of ammo in a clip to 10 rounds per clip, what is someone who is attacking another person going to do? Grab another clip. Thus nullifying any and all purpose to the limitation.

Another feature to the assault weapon is that it is semi-automatic. It is able to fire a round and automatically load another. These military style weapons are not the only types of weapons that can do this. There are pistols, hunting rifles and shotguns that do the exact same thing, and probably do more damage. I have an old Russian Mosin-Nagant. It is bolt action, but the calibre of the round is very high. I will tell you, that if I were to shoot you with it, there wouldn't be much of you left. This is a weapon of war and was used as such. Is this weapon on the table for gun control? No. Why? Because it doesn't fit the criteria used as propaganda by the left.

If I use a baseball bat to harm somebody, isn't that an assault weapon? Didn't I just assault somebody with that weapon? Should baseball bats be banned as an assault weapon then?

The democrats will cry out, ""No! Because the baseball bat can't kill a lot of people with little effort."" So chemicals used to create bombs, which are easily attainable, are not to be controlled? Just guns because there is a fear?

As the spokesman for the NRA stated: The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
I don't understand how that is debatable. People will always find ways to do harm to other people. We cannot stop the creation of evil, but we can stop it in its tracks.

c7mn3mv,c7mtbzx,"Well, let me talk about my general theory about economic issues, that's probably the biggest point of disagreement.   I am a believer in the free market, I think that the free market is the best way to generate wealth for the most people, but I think that the free market must be regulated because there are inherent flaws in an unregulated free market.   One major flaw is what economists call ""the tragedy of the commons""; people will tend to use up public resources of all types in order to make themselves richer (environmental, infrastructure, public services, ect) and will tend to do so without giving enough back to make up for what they took.  If this is allowed to continue indefinably without some kind of regulation or taxation, eventually all public resources will be destroyed; factories will use up the clean air, farmers will use up fresh water, fishers will use up all the fish, infrastructure will decay.  This has happened over and over again in history; just look at what happened in the mid-west: first there was one valuable economic resource, the buffalo, but the buffalo hunters killed too many buffalo until they were basically gone.   That left those huge grasslands; cattlemen let their cows graze on the open range, the famous cowboy era, but this only lasted a few decades in real life; there were too many cows, they overgrazed the grass, and then the whole system collapsed, tens of thousands of of cows starved to death over a horrible winter, and that resource was gone.  Then farmers came out, except they over-farmed the soil, exhausted it's nutrients, and then when a drought came what was left of the exhausted topsoil blew away in the Dust Bowl. That's just one example, but basically, I think the only way to avoid the tragedy of the commons is a strong, central government capable of regulating, taxing, and requiring environmental protection.

Edit: For one specific example of how this happened, here is a study about overgrazing in Arazona during the 1880's.

http://sciencequest.webplus.net/Noonan,%20G.%20R.%202011.%20The%20overgrazing%20of%20Arizona%20rangelands.pdf

The land in Arizona has STILL not completely recovered from the overgrazing of public lands during this time period, even after 130 years have passed.   People think that environmental disasters are a new thing, but they're not; destroying natural resources by overuse is a mistake we have made over and over again, and it is a natural consequence of the unregulated free market.   

The general economic rule that I'm talking about, the ""Tragedy of the commons"", is summarized pretty well here.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons

A second basic flaw in capitalism that I think only a strong government can handle is the fundamental ""the rich get richer"" nature of capitalism. By definition, if you have more capital, you will invest it and become more rich over time.   Which is fine, capital is what makes the system work, but if that process continues indefinably, eventually a small number of people control almost all the wealth, and at that point capitalism itself starts to break down; the super-rich start to protect themselves from the free market, from competition, and the society becomes less of a capitalistic democracy and more of an oligarchy.  The best way to prevent this collapse is a government capable of taxing the super-rich and using that money to provide at least basic services to everyone else; at the very least, the basic tools that they need to create their own wealth, like education, infrastructure, and so on.  There are other non-governmental tools that can help prevent this from happening, such as labor unions organizing labor to increase it's value, but frankly those are becoming weaker and starting to break down right now, so I think we need a strong government that is willing to do taxation that has redistribute results in order to maintain the system.",PoliticalDebate,1356624692.0,Yosarian2,3.0,3,0.0,15hzrs,"What would you say your number one reason for being a Democrat is?

c7moscd,c7mtffp,"I think that right now, during a recession, it's ok to run a significant deficit, so long as we pay it off later. I think that Keynesian economics is correct; during a severe recession, people and businesses tend to spend less and save more, which makes the recession worse, and the only way to counterbalance that is for the government to borrow and spend money during a recession.

However, that's just a short term issue.  I think we should have had balanced budgets in the 2000's, when the economy was better, and I think we will need to balance the budget again in a few years when the economy starts to get better again.

In the medium term, once the economy recovers and tax revenues get back up to what they were before the current recession, it's actually not all that hard to balance the budget.   Going back to Clinton-era tax rates is a start. We might need to raise taxes on the rich a little higher then they were during that era, we should probably also cut millitary spending, and I wouldn't be opposed to other spending cuts at that point in time, but balancing the budget in, say, 2015 isn't really that hard.

The long-term issue is totally driven by medical care.  Medicare is increasing in cost every year, and so is all medical care (the VA, medical insurance for state and federal employees, medicaid, charity care, ect).  Not only will this eventually bankrupt the government, it will also eventually bankrupt all private businesses that pay medical insurance.   So, we need to get the rising cost of medical care under control.  This is a really complicated issue with a lot of moving parts; there are some things in Obamacare that I think will help a little, but we are going to have to find a way to do comprehensive reform to our whole medical system to get costs under control without lowering the quality of services.   

Edit: It has been suggested to me that I should add some sources, which is a good idea.

This is a graph of projected costs of meidcare and medicaid going foward:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Medicare_and_Medicaid_GDP_Chart.svg

As you can see, the real problem here isn't the aging population, it's the rising cost of medical care over time.  Medical care has been going up faster then inflation for years, and it hasn't stopped yet.   This is really the main long-term budget issue; if we solve this problem, we'll be fine.

This isn't a problem specific to medicare, though.  it's a fundamental problem in the health care system as a whole.

c7n7whk,c7n94kj,"In general, for most of my life, I have been in favor of taxes on everyone.  I wouldn't be opposed to paying higher taxes myself if I was getting better services for them of equal or greater value to me then the taxes I was paying.  (I think that's quite possible; for example, I think that everyone in the US has gotten greater utility from the interstate highway system then we initially paid in taxes to build it.)  It's not that taxes are inherently good or bad, just that if we can take tax money and invest it in ways that are good for us as a whole, it's good for the nation.

I talk about higher taxes for the wealthy now, because right now, I think things have gotten out of balance.  Taxes on the wealthy have declined, several times, while the gap between the rich and the rest have increased.   I don't think that's a direct causal effect; I think that a bunch of new technologies breaking through often cause a small number of people to become super-rich.   I think that the net effect, though, is bad for society and for democracy; I think that we had some serious negative effects on democracy last time we got to this point (the ""robber baron"" period with Rockefeller and Carnegie), and I think we're getting the same effects now.   Aside from that, I think that the perception that the super-rich who are making most of their money from capital gains taxes are paying very little in taxes (Romney's famous 13% being a well known example) causes people to lose faith in the whole system.  

So, yes, right now, in our current state, I think we should raise taxes on the rich.

c7n6n6l,c7n98da,"This is a huge issue, with a lot of things that should be done.   I'll just mention a few big things we could do right now that would make a significant difference.

 First of all, the way we fund schools mostly with local property tax is just foolish; the inevitable effect of that is that schools in poor areas with low property values will get less funding and be worse schools, even though it's actually more expensive to run a school in a poor district.  Funding schools primarily with something like a state income tax would make a lot more sense.

Another big thing that I think we should seriously consider is getting rid of the whole ""summer vacation"" idea.   A lot of schools in other countries, instead of one 3 month vacation, do something like ""3 weeks of school, one week off"" all year round.   There's been a lot of research on summer vacations, and generally speaking, if you test kids before they go on summer vacation and after they come back, you will see test scores drop.   It's pretty common knowledge that students forget a lot over the summer, and the first month of school is often just trying to re-teach and review things that the students forgot.  This problem is especially bad for students from backgrounds where they don't have as many books or newspapers at home; they tend to lose much of their reading skill over summer vacation.

I also think that there is a problem that the way we do high-stakes standardized tests strictly for math and reading tends to discourage elementary school teachers from spending time teaching things that are equally important, like science and history.  Science especially seems to suffer in the elementary school curriculum these days.

In general, I think that we need to re-think a lot of things we do in education.  We seem to be in this weird trap where the right wing talks about ""education reform"" as a way to save money, while the left wing wants to keep things pretty much the same.   I don't know why people aren't willing to consider education reform that might cost more money but also might work better or be more efficient.

c7ndfht,c7ndjfa,"I'm not really sure what the Supreme Court is going to decide.

In the long run, though, I'm not sure it matters.  I think that even if it is found to be constitutional, that Congress is going to get rid of DOMA sometime in the next 2-4 years; it's becoming harder and harder for Republicans to continue to defend the law as popular opinion continues to move more and more in favor of gay marriage.  And I think that over time, more and more states are going to decide to allow gay marriage, no matter what the court decides on Prop 8.

Either way, I think gay marriage is coming.  

If you put me in a corner and made me guess, I would guess that the Supreme Court is probably going to throw out DOMA on narrow grounds of unequal treatment under the federal tax code for gay couples legally considered to be married by their states.  They could go farther then that and say something about gay marriage itself, but I don't really expect it at this point.

c7neclv,c7neu0z,"Well, on a fundamental level, unions aren't really political organizations.  They're organized labor; a group of workers that got together and decided that they wanted to be treated better, who decided to refuse as a collective group to work unless they get paid a basic living wage, and unions organized like that have done a lot of good for this country.  The 40 hour workweek, higher pay, sick days, and so on have largely come into existence because of unions.

I don't really think public worker unions are any different from any other type of unions here.  It's still just a group of workers organized for better conditions.   

As for your other question, I think the ""voting"" thing is a red herring.   There's no union for senior citizens, but don't you think senior citizens vote for who is going to keep social security and medicaid over someone who is going to cut them?  There is no union for military personal, but if someone ran for office on the platform that he was going to cut all military wages, don't you think people in the military will vote against them?

c7o5arf,c7o9tma,"1) I'm not enough of an expert on the tax policies of other countries to really answer question 1.  My intuition would be that there aren't any other countries that closely model either party's ideal, but I can't really say, sorry.

2) We just had a debate about this.   To summerize, I think there are some simple, effective gun control things that we could do without hurting any legitimate usage of guns.  I don't really think there is any necessary reason for a civilian to have assault rifles; it's not really idea for self defense or for hunting, so I think banning them wouldn't have any significant cost.   I would also like to see some loopholes closed, like the loophole where individuals can sell guns to other individuals without a background check (this is also the ""gun show"" loophole).  And I would like to see national laws like the one they have in California, where there is a limit on how many guns you can buy per month (anyone buying 20 guns a month isn't a collector, he's almost certainly re-selling them on the black market).   I think with some simple measures like that, we can probably reduce homicides somewhat.  Black market guns have to be pretty cheap and pretty ubiquitous for them to get into the hands of, say, teenaged gang members; even some moderate measures to make them a little harder to get should reduce that kind of low-level gang violence in our cities significantly.

3) Honestly, I don't spend much time worrying about constitutional amendments, because they are really hard to do, and in most cases there are easier ways to accomplish the same goals.   That being said, I would support a constitutional amendment that made the Presidential election into a more direct election; I think that the electoral college doesn't really serve a need, and right now it is basically warping elections by making large numbers of voters basically not matter at all; all the Republicans in California, for example, will not have any effect on the outcome of the presidential election no matter what they do, so long as we have a winner-take-all electoral college system.   

I also think that the recent Supreme Court decision that ""corporations are people"" and that stop us from regulating money in politics was wrong, and I would support the people who are in favor of a constitutional amendment to correct that.

ekb2jc2,eku184x,"&gt;Mindlessly carry out the law

Ever heard of the term ‘beyond their duty’ you might hear it on the news a lot, for example, cop sacrificed himself by crashing into drunk driver that was driving on the wrong side of the road, killing the cop instantly when even the police officer decided to slow down before impact while the drunk driver still drove at breakneck speeds, to save the drunk driver aswell. It is not his duty to do that, if he was to mindlessly carry out the law, his task would’ve been to warn the people in way of the driver, and follow the driver until they crashed or decided to takedown their vehicle at the safest time at possible. The cops who sacrificed their lives to save others, were not mindlessly following the law.

&gt;arrest them over a tiny bag of weed

this is most common among rookie cops who have to meet quotas on arrests over the course of 3-6 months. Most experienced cops will let you go, I know many cops who bun off duty. Most of them are chill with it.

40

% of cops do not do whatever you’re claiming they do.

The 40% number is almost always wrongly stated. It isn't ""40% of cops abuse their wives"" like everybody keeps saying, it's “40 percent of the officers stated that in the last six months prior to the survey they had gotten out of control and behaved violently against their spouse and children"" and their definition of violence is completely absent from the study. Now, we can tell that it is not talking about physical abuse alone because they cited the numbers in relation to the 16% rate among the civilian population, and we know that 16% of relationships aren't experiencing physical violence within the last 6 months. The rate for civilians experiencing physical abuse is about about 5:1000 or .5:1000

So yes, according to that study police families are about twice as likely to have some form of violence, but it's not physical violence, or rather this study does not detail the rate of physical violence among those families, and the vast majority of the violence described among LEOs and civilians is verbal violence.

To make things even more stupid, The 40% study itself is likely extremely flawed. I think It had a sample size of under 400 and was self reported. Meaning it was probably a questionnaire where the surveyors decided what was abuse—most of the “abuse” being arguments, etc.

And was likely only in one/a few department (s) (I think Philadelphia was one) so it is likely to be very skewed because of the particularly bad areas it was done in.

And many times it just counts any “abuse” that occurs in their relationship—even it it’s the cop being abused

One article about the survey also says that the domestic abuse rate in the average population is 10%, and another study said the domestic abuse rate (for slightly older officers) was about 24%

According to the actual survey, the abuse rate for the general population is about 16%

And they (the study) are also almost 30 years old.

They are not reliable and you would need new, detailed studies in order to actually know—but doing them isn’t easy.

Other studies have shown different results(but they are complicated).

There aren’t many articles written about it—but don’t count on it as a reliable statistic

However, the points that you make after that I disagree with. He doesn’t surround himself with white people. He has a very diverse cabinet, and he even hosted a black history month dinner at the White House

The reason he targets those 4 representatives is because they have targeted him as well. I get what your saying, it sounds racist if you don’t know the context. However, with context, and also looking at the caucasian people he has also “targeted” (Biden, Pelosi, etc.) its clear there is no white supremacy involved there.

Does that north south dichotomy balance for population density?  There is also much more opportunity for shipping and trade in the north and coast than the central south so geography is a large part of that.

Surely it would be better to find out if liberal policies are being implemented into those states and compare them with other states having the same economic potential and roughly the same population to see if liberal policies are actually helping or hurting.

This is a strawman for the following reasons:

1. Right-wingers NEVER say Democrat policies result in the poorest states. They say blacks mostly live in or around large metropolitan cities and those metropolitan cities are dominated by Democrats and Democrat policies. This is a fact since most black Americans only live 10 southern states -- Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Louisiana, Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississipp...[6 in 10 blacks to be exact.](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/census_2000/cb01cn176.html) 
2. The poorest states have the least amount of industry and development and have historically been Democrat strongholds until the 1970s and 1980s. Thus, if you believe in the concept of ""generational wealth"" or believe that blacks in the USA had a massive disadvantage early on and that impacts the outcomes of blacks today then the same racist Democrat policies that have held black Americans back have also put these states far behind.

g67kmbn,g67t2ct,"&gt;The Data sets are inadmissible because they delineate hispanics as ""white""

That's not up to you.

In 1929, [the League of the United Latin American Citizens](http://lulac.org/) (LULAC), a Mexican-American organization, formed in Corpus Christi, TX. One of their main organizing efforts was to get ""Mexican"" off the 1930 census. They protested: we are white race, we are Americans. It has been consistent since then.

Latinos can be of a variety of racial backgrounds. People can be Afro-Latino and be white and be Latino and there are a whole lot of Latinos who are brown, like me. So there's the issue of not wanting to be racialized, and there's the racial diversity of Latinos themselves.

I am originally from Houston, Texas, and if you ask anyone what ""Hispanic"" means the most common response you will receive is that it's someone of Mexican origin who was born in the USA. The reason is that the overwhelming majority of Latinos in Texas are people of Mexican origin, so they use that term. This is similar to New Mexico. Hispanic became the category that means a U.S.-born Mexican-American person.

If you ask somebody in New York who is Hispanic, they're going to give you a different answer. If you talk to somebody in Florida, they're going to have a different answer. So these terms have different meanings throughout this country.

Thus the question is how do you properly define what is ""Hispanic"" on the Census? This is also why ""Non-Hispanic whites"" are on the Census because many Hispanics are in fact ""white"" and thus identify as such.

Therefore, the data sets are irrefutable since they follow the Census Bureau's categorization of demographics perfectly and the corresponding demographics identify as they believe they should be represented. Your personal interpretation of what ""Hispanic"" means is incorrect, I'm afraid.",PoliticalDebate,1600785012.0,End-Da-Fed,,-5,,ixmsix,[removed],[deleted],,7,,1600780077.0,[removed],IDislikeYourMeta,,38,1600779215.0

g681jym,g681pxz,"&gt; *&gt;  The ratio of unarmed black men shot and killed (23) in 2018 was 1 out of 67,334 black men arrested.* [*According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting, there were 686,665 sworn police officers in the United States in 2018*](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-74)*. That’s one unarmed black male shot and killed for every 49,047 sworn police officers.* [*Out of the nearly 47.8 million black Americans*](https://blackdemographics.com/)*, the police have shot roughly one unarmed black male per roughly 2.1 million people.* 

You do nothing to back up the claim that ""*The ratio of unarmed black men shot and killed (23) in 2018 was 1 out of 67,334 black men arrested.""* You then go on to compare that to all police officers in the country arbitrarily as if that somehow justifies the over policing and killing of blacks over other races by police officers. Also, assuming this data isn't from absolutely nowhere, this data doesn't take into account a lot of different factors. It's mathematical approximation that came from near nowhere with no representation of outside factors or actual statistics. You gave me 2 population statistics I need the third.

&gt;*&gt;*  [*The inevitable conversation that follows is that black people only represent 14% of the US population*](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219)***,***  *how is it that they make up such a high number of overall police  deaths\*\*.\*\* blm and it's supporters would like to propagate the idea  that it's racism. Which fortunately has little factual basis in this  topic. This is where we need to have those brutal, honest conversations  that everyone claims to want to have regarding race (silence is violence  after all), but nobody is actually allowed to discuss without being banned, canceled or called a racist nazi.*  
&gt;  
&gt;[*In  the US, the American black population represents 53% of convicted  murders, 29% of rapes, 54% of robberies, 33% of assaults, 43% of weapons  charges, 29% of domestic abuse and 27% of drug abuse violations among  others (continuing to over index in almost all areas of remaining crime)*](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)*.  The vast majority of these crimes were conducted by males, meaning that  half of the violent crime in America is committed by less than the  roughly 6-7% of black men in the US. It's not only understandable but  expected that there would be a higher degree of violence involved in  these arrests, as usually the type of person that's being arrested for  murder isn't likely to go without a fight, nor would they like to spend  their lives in prison. Ignoring these facts is tantamount to delusion.*

Dear lord not this again. We call people who use this statistic nazis because they either are or are being pipelined. simple as that. It takes near nothing into account outside of these statistics in the first place; it's completely tunnel vision toward these numbers. I will simply share [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/bctbmg/i_need_a_counter_to_1350/eku89kf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) with you for you to read on a post about how to counter this terrible alt-right dog whistle. These numbers come from absolutely nowhere and are only propagated because they support an alt-right agenda. Please look into your sources carefully. Think about this in all directions. Are blacks doing 50% of crime or are they being persecuted 5x as much? This makes it seem that blacks are somehow an indicator for crime, but poverty is a much more respectable and accurate predictor for crime. It also just so happens that minorities are in poverty due to systemic reasons rather than innate ones as proven by many studies not only on America but on every other civilization. Things are MUCH more complex than 2 numbers. YES this is related to policing of blacks, YES this is due to outside factors, NO 1 [blacks do not](https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/06/stop-using-black-on-black-crime-to-deflect-away-from-police-brutality.html) 2 [have a problem](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/color-of-justice-racial-and-ethnic-disparity-in-state-prisons/) 3 [with violence](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf).

&gt;*&gt;*  [*Keeping  the aforementioned statistics in mind, each year, American cops kill  more white people, both in raw numbers and when adjusted for crime  rates, than black people*](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877) *(note: the study has since been retracted  due to public inference, however, the data included remains valid, even  more studies with similar findings below)*

Yeah cops kill a ton of people. They kill more whites in TOTAL due to population differences, but it still stands that they kill more blacks on AVERAGE. Despite making up 13% of the population they get killed many more times over than whites. This statistic and claim make no sense together. The linked page has no mention of blacks at all. In fact this article sucks incredibly. Theres an included refinement and correction [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/3/1263). Heres the Tl;Dr:

&gt; **A recent PNAS article reports “no evidence of anti-Black or  anti-Hispanic disparities across \[fatal\] shootings” by police officers  (ref.** [**1**](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/3/1263#ref-1)**,  p. 15877). This claim is based on the results of a regression model  that suggested “a person fatally shot by police was 6.67 times less  likely (odds ratio \[*****OR*****\] = 0.15 \[0.09, 0.27\]) to be Black than White” (ref.** [**1**](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/3/1263#ref-1)**, p. 15880). The article also claims the results “do not depend on which predictors are used” (ref.** [**1**](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/3/1263#ref-1)**,  p. 15881). These claims are misleading because the reported results  apply only to a subset of victims and do not control for the fact that  we would expect a higher number of White victims simply because the  majority of US citizens are White.** 

There is also an overwhelming majority of studies disproving your article. This evidence in cherry picked.

&gt;*&gt;  Contrary to the black lives matter narrative, the police have much more  to fear from black males than black males have to fear from the police.*[*In 2015, black civil-rights commissioner Peter Kirsanow famously defended the police*](https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/hans-bader/narrative-racist-police-killings-melts-when-you-know-these-stats) *by acknowledging that* [*a  police officer is roughly 18.5x more likely to be killed by a black  male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer, a  number that's been repeated ad nauseam and is roughly supported by  statistics year after year (it lowers to roughly 2.5x more likely for a  cop to be killed by armed black males than the reverse)*](https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2018/topic-pages/officers-feloniously-killed)*. Factually,  black males have made up nearly 50 percent of all cop-killers over the  last decade even though they are only 6-7% of the overall population.* 

This isn't even accurately based in fact. The linked statistics don't even mention blacks. In fact there isn't a SINGLE mention of race here. Where are you getting any of this? This only mentions officers who died in the line of duty and includes things like dying while helping a mental health crisis. It mentions no specifics at all and that is by design. **You can't twist this to turn toward blacks with no basis for this.**

&gt;*&gt;*  *the epidemic of black-on-black violence increasing across the country.* 

People have been talking about black on black crime forever. What most people object to are solutions to this that make this problem worse, like over policing as opposed to better opportunities. Blacks and other minorities live in poverty due to systemic reasons, and poverty breeds violence and crime. This is not somehow a black issue, nor is it the fault of blacks, nor is it somehow innately within those who commit violent acts.",PoliticalDebate,1600789406.0,WeegeeNator,,14,,ixmsix,"&gt;\&gt; *black lives matter as both an organization and as a ""social statement""  were founded primarily on the basis of  ""systemic racism"" and ""police  brutality"". Both of which have very little merit outside of left-wing echo-chambers, with almost all of its messaging crumbling under the  slightest bit of scrutiny (if it's supporters ever bothered to  scrutinize what they are being indoctrinated by).* 

Systemic racism and police brutality are largely supported as being legitimate by just about everyone. Police brutality happens to all races and in many different countries. Systemic racism is a result of the decades of prejudice against minorities in this country, and is also seen as legitimate in any respectable academic circle. You can see systemic racism in [red lining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining), stop and frisk policy, [racism ingrained into culture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704191/pdf/nihms482504.pdf) (affecting our judgement), [the large gap in income and opportunity between whites and black](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html) people, and lots of more examples. Blacks and other minorities are at an inherent disadvantage due to both previous and current racist policy. Police brutality is also an enormous issue no matter who you are, but [ESPECIALLY](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) if you are black. Research on race in relation to crime shows blacks are 5x (and up to 10x in some states) more likely to be incarcerated than whites. This is due to many systemic problems.

&gt;\&gt;  *Whether you support their cause or not, both blm and antifa as organizations fit the literal definition of terrorism... ...blm/antifa and their supporters are responsible for a great number of  increasingly violent attacks in recent years targeted towards opposing views (namely white people and Trump supporters), where they've earned the ire that's currently directed towards them. It's time we collectively began to address these left-wing extremists for what they  truly are.* 

This is very similar to saying the French Revolution was terrorism, or that the protests and riots in the 60s were terrorism, or that worker uprisings in the early industrial age were terrorism. You could only consider these terrorism if you were a member of the oppression or a sympathizer. Also Antifa is no an organization. Antifa is a loose ideology based around resisting fascism. There is no CEO of Antifa or head of Antifa Ohio or something. This is like saying we should declare Anonymous a terrorist organization despite them being completely decentralized and loose. This has dangerous implications. Also, [Antifa have had next to no violent acts or killings associated with them ever](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/27/us-rightwing-extremists-attacks-deaths-database-leftwing-antifa). Right wing terrorism on the other hand happens every other day. 9/11 is an example of far right terrorism. 

&gt; ""Systemic racism"" is a catch-all term for any and everything to do with  race, applied ad hoc to whatever scenarios people would like changed,  whether that's in the public and private school systems, our systems of  law and the histories of great nations. No legal definition or even  standard application of the word has been decided, and everyone has  their own variation on what the word means. And yet, [governmental bodies themselves](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ends-critical-race-theory-training-federal-employees) and [people are changing the way we act, talk and think](https://newdiscourses.com/2020/06/reasons-critical-race-theory-terrible-dealing-racism/) in order to combat [this vague THEORY (and I stress that word)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ujq4iAgUMw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=FreethePeople). 

Systemic racism has everything to do with race as I explained above. As for these sources, they are extremely biased (Fox new article, Newdiscource article (which makes some very baseless claims by the way), and a youtube video). Fox News is constantly pushing agenda and obviously has interests above factual reporting as demonstrated MANY times before. Newdiscource constantly talks about [critical theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/) without actually defining it. Ironically they use it as a ""catch-all term for any and everything to do with race"" and social justice, isn't that something. The youtube channel linked as well as the video provided make some very bad claims as well. They completely misrepresent the ideas behind critical theory and ensure to depict many ideas surround it as ridiculous. Lots of buzzwords and buzz phrases, as well as watered down definitions filled with those buzzwords. 

&gt; *&gt;* [*In American cops make about 10,000,000 arrests a year*](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191261/number-of-arrests-for-all-offenses-in-the-us-since-1990/)*.  Those ten million arrests don't include detentions, traffic stops or  any of the other peaceful public interactions that make up the remaining  approximately 60,000,000 police and citizen contact every year.* [*On average per year, only about 1,000 of those 70 MILLION people interacted with end up dead due to police*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/)*.  Yet, people act like their chances of dying at the hands of a cop are  anything but minuscule. The entire blm narrative is built on the  foundation of ""police brutality"" and ""racism"" that simply isn't  reflected in reality.* 

This is blatant source mixing and misrepresentation of data. The conclusions drawn here are nothing short of speculation. The first statistic is completely irrelevant. Arrests a year do not matter in this situation. And the washington post article linked goes exactly against what you say. The data set literally represents: 1. ONLY FATAL SHOOTINGs of police officers in the last YEAR, 2. shows that the rate of shooting is steady and that blacks get shot more often (exactly what BLM fights against), 3. This mentioned no where 70 million people, **nor is it an average.** This data set is the washington post logging since 2015 and only logging fatal shootings from on duty cops. It quite literally shows that minorities are not only much more likely to be a victim but also that this happens steadily over years.

&gt;*&gt;  We're not even going to begin to discuss how many of those 1,000 people killed by cops each year are armed and dangerous (which is the majority of cases)* 

???? This is completely baseless and completely false. [Blacks on average are less likely to be armed than whites](https://www.statista.com/statistics/623356/gun-ownership-in-the-us-by-ethnicity/), and you assume that they're armed and dangerous why?

People already have the choice do it on their own, that's not a big deal. I think if companies can implement it on their own, that's brilliant that would raise collective consciousness. Markets are also obviously protected. 

So what I propose comes under ""My take"", which I think is a workable/improved proposition. It needs to be legislated across the nation. It applies only to big business. Small and medium size businesses are left completely alone. This regulation only applies companies that make 'X' amount of profit. Big tech and all monopolies in the market would be regulated this way.

My take has not been because it is selectively applied and not applied to all businesses. That is why I personally call it 'Democratizing the hierarchies'. It's not giving full ownership to workers. Profit models will not be affected because small and medium sized businesses will not be affected in anyway. I suspect the workers would be more happier since any change in their material conditions would require their collective consent. Remember only workers with 10 years of experience can vote not ALL.

Although I don't like to put too much stock in predictions overall, I think it would be reasonable to assume the margin of victory will not be so significant. As other people have said, factors such as an ongoing pandemic and the resulting increase in mail-in voting could run contrary to the establishment media's overwhelming drive to publicize results immediately. Adding to the equation the electoral college, the sheer power of incumbency, and the fact that 'coverage is king' gives Trump strong odds, IMO. 

As for the police reform, on a federal level, I don't see how either main party could be expected to offer radical change. BUT, the best idea in that regard that I have come across (and maybe this would only need to happen on a district level) is that taxpayers should no longer have to pay for their police department's legal misconduct settlements.

I'll be frank, I am voting for Biden and down party line, but I'll explain that later on in this comment. I choose not to argue with my allies and I actually do listen. I'm going to do my best to steelman them, then insert my own opinion.

Actually, let me correct something: Scandinavian countries are not SOCIALIST. They are SOCIAL Democracies. They are have simply added some social programs with some regulations on capitalism. Capitalists still own the means of production, not the people or state. These countries still have a ways to go before they become socialist. 

Now to your average American boomer who's been fed a diet of anti-communist propaganda their whole lives, everything that economically on the left side of the political compass is COMMUNISM and COMMUNISM MEANS NO FREEDOM AND THEY'RE TO TAKE OUR LAND AND GUNS AND MONEY AND TV AND FOOD!!!! IT'LL JUST BE LIKE THE USSSR MAN. THESE COMMIES WANT TO TAKE OUR FREEDOM!?!?!?!? And that is obviously not true. We just want to change the system to be more moral and free for the individual. But what we do and how is on a wide spectrum and no one can really agree on the right answer to our problem. But there are two main camps people can be put under Reformist (me and OP) and Revolutionaries (the people you are probably thinking).  


Revolutionaries are people with pretty radical and far-left ideas about how are the system. So far in fact that Trump and Biden look like ants. They look similar to each other and they're right. Biden is way closer to Trump than Biden is to them. And Biden is really garbage to the far left. He spends a lot of time making sure he doesn't look like a socialist because those reactionary boomers who unfortunately really like to vote a lot more than young people. He doesn't endorse M4A, Green New Deal, Abolishing the Police, etc. despite what the Red Scare propaganda machine will tell you. They don't feel welcomed by Biden. They think our bourgeoise (rich elite) government will NEVER accept them. It would just be better if the whole system went away. 

There's also violence from the state. Most people don't really think about how violent the state is until it happens to them. But every system has violence from someone and the USA is pretty violent. An obvious example is the police a.k.a. ""The world's most dangerous game of Simon Says"". If you scare the cops, they're free to turn you into swiss cheese. It's easier for them to lose their job for speaking out than to go to jail for murdering citizens. That's messed up. Police only have their morals and their feelings to guide them when they can use violence against their own citizens. But Biden doesn't want to fix that. He'll let that violence slide.   


There's also ""imperial fascism"" (IDK there's a proper term because I can't find it) or violence in foreign countries when we go to war and we kill innocent civilians and do war crimes. Pretty much every president is considered a war criminal because we always at war with some country for some stupid reason. There's also our lack of medical care is killing millions of Americans. But wait, there's more! There's also climate change coming around the corner coming to wreck our planet causing not only people to die but also ecosystems and countries. We are going to have a lot of climate refugees in the coming years.   
Thanks, capitalism for putting profits over lives!   


And guess what Biden wants to do? ""Oh let me just give you some Obamacare and some carbon tax to make you feel better. I know it's not much but we don't want to lose our corporate donors by doing too much. I gotta compromise."" It's pathetic. And to them, a vote for Biden is an endorsement of this. It is to settle. And worse they fear that this will make people comfortable again and not want change. They'll still be seen as radicals, people will still die, and maybe after 4 years of Trump, we can nominate a radical candidate that shares our values. If we vote 3rd party we can show we will vote, but not for them until they change. Or they don't and want a USSR revolution take over. But of course that crap.  


Now for my opinion

Ok hi, reformist socialist here to tell you to get your head out of your ass so you can see we are about to put into a mass grave. Biden and democrats do hate us, but at least they don't want to murder us. They also like us to vote which is nice, unlike the Republicans who spend a lot of their time trying to get a few people to vote as possible. They only speak in lying propaganda machines. They get WAY more money from corporations. They mess up the government so much and then just blame the democrats or the deep state or the radicals or the poor or the illegals. Man, why can't those Democrats just comprise more and stop fighting with those Republicans? They're always fighting. Both sides amirite? And they act this way because they want to stay in power and they can do so as long as rural folks stay hooked on right-wing propaganda that gives them a false sense of consciousness and worries about the pettiest things like gender bathrooms and the war on Christmas rather than actual policies that would make the world a better place.

Did I mention they want us dead? Those right-wingers sure got a lot of guns and zero empathy for us. And after watching hours of the same violent riots on loop, so they're ripe and ready for civil war. OH BOY! Can't wait to get slaughtered like sheep. 

Now, this may sound nuts and paranoid which it does, but sadly it's true. We live in radical times. Whenever there are new ways to communicate comes cultural conflict. The printing press ultimately led to the reformation of the church, radio and TV ultimately aided the rise of fascism in Europe and now the Internet has made this. I don't think I need to explain how the Internet has caused chaos in our country. And the only way we can end it is to reach a common consense. And whoever wins gets to help stir to either fascism or whatever Biden does. 

I honestly don't sure which way we'll go with Biden, but I do know his supporters will lose their ego and power if Trump is out of office. And maybe can plug a few holes in this sinking ship to give so more time to sway more people into socialism. I can definitely not talk about socialism if I'm dead because of some coward who watches too much Fox news.

g86jp2w,g86rj9i,"This seems to be pretty misinformed. If you research the thorough history of each Political party you'll find that the Republican party was founded as an opposition to slavery and westward spread of slavery, while the Democratic party were the party for slave harboring. Not only that, the Democrats less favored the Civil Rights acts. Further from slavery, both World Wars had a sitting Democratic President. 

Democrats used to be the party of ""conservative values"" up until Roosevelt and completed the transition during the Civil Rights passages in the 60s. Over that time, and especially from Roosevelt's agenda, those politicians changed the parties agenda to more ""progressive"" policies rather than keeping things the same ""conservative.""

As for ""Authoritarian"", the Republican core wants small state in favor of more libertarian ideals which is what the framers were originally (inspiration from John Locke.)  Compare that to the modern Democrat party whose policy agenda is to nationalize social and economic policies which is inherantly authoritative. Both modern parties are in fact moreso authoritative than libertarian, but because of those facts the Republican party is not as authoritative.

However I'm sure you're looking at the Republican's history with being more anti-immigration, which is authoritative, since you made a comment about Nazi sympathizing. The Nazi party was extremely authoritative to the point where they were nearly a complete textbook definition of a totalitarian state. To clarify possible confusion: Nazi's were a bit leaning to communist economics. A pure totalitarian party would be a Hivemind, and in a pure totalitarian state it's essentially one mind controls all and economics is owned only by one so economics is essentially irrelevant at that point. It's nothing new from a historical perspective, going all the way back to the dawn of men, and throughout the past millennia, for there to be concern about new people moving in. When you get new neighbors you'd generally be concerned if they are loud, jerks, or messy individuals. When an immigrant moves in without proper documentation, similar to squatting, that's an issue when they are expecting similar rights and equal paying jobs. Legal Americans are documented and pay their share of taxes. The issue is that there isn't an efficient process in place, but letting people through without being processed in isn't the solution. We've already seen the result of not doing so during 9/11. For Democrats to hypocritically say that this is fascist, when it's not, it's in fact red tape for the security of the people, which is what government should only exist for, the Democratic party insists on many measures that restrict rights such affirmative action in the workspace which requires discriminatory hiring practices, and Gun Laws while the second Amendment is written in the old english way of saying ""The government may not restrict in any form at all"" so that tyranny (authority, government) cannot leave the civilians powerless.

Based on history you'll find a pattern of not only the modern Democratic party, but the past Democratic party, being more Nazi-like and authoritative, while the Republican's history shows the opposite for almost all their policies.

The fundamental issue we're seeing today is the failure of a two party system to properly represent voter views, where they change positions to join forces with a side, just like Harris did with Biden (and Biden did with so many other policies.) This is a result of a winner-take-all system (FTPT) which was birthed by the framers. You'll remember how Washington did not want there to be any parties, that's because he knew we'd be sloshed in this kind of situation right now. Two parties that are so disoriented by their desire to stay in power and rule. At the same time this was the best they could make to avoid a pure democracy's inevitable mob rule culture, and a tyrannical state.

Personally I believe in a libertarian approach, the way the framers did, with some Democratic social program policies, and Republican fiscal policies. The government should intervene only when individuals or corps hold too much power, or when rights are being discriminated against. Unfortunately we are in a two party system, and so it's basically pick one or the other. I'm gonna pick one, not only based on my personal beliefs, but also based on factual track record.

The families and kids who have have fallen into the social trap of modern day identity politics have been left out in the cold by the LGBT communities as ""false flags"" and weapons of the ""alt-right"" in the supposed battle against the trans community.

[With the fastest growing population of under aged kids believing that they are now transsexual](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/culture-mind-and-brain/201811/why-is-transgender-identity-the-rise-among-teens), it's vital as a first world population to have those difficult conversations in order to protect the well-being of this and future generations.

[This is also partially having adverse effects, as recently acceptance of the gay community among young people is actually going down](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/24/lgbtq-acceptance-millennials-decline-glaad-survey/1503758001/). Advocates would argue that this is because of ""hateful rhetoric"" from certain groups (that factually isn't there) endorsing the homophobia. But as always, supporters refuse to acknowledge the easier answer, and the the very real impacts the trans community and it's identity politics is having on society and our young people. You simply can't attack other people based on their gender or skin or sexuality (straight white men for example) and not expect a logical backlash even from people who would otherwise be allies.

g8bsw0t,g8ci664,"Ooof okay. This whole questions shows, how politics constantly enters spaces it has nothing to do in and how everyone loves to form opinions about stuff they don't know about very well. And I can't even accuse you of being ignorant, because I used to think the exact same way just one year ago. 


TL;DR in the front so you don't have to scroll down:


Transitioning is not as easy as you think, gender dysphoria is a diagnosable psychological condition and a bad health care system causes bad treatment.


Now the long version:



First of all, transitioning isn't a neutral decision. It is a treatment for severe gender dysphoria. You don't wake up one day and decide you want to change your gender. 


From asking trans people I'd describe the usual progress like this:


You experience a weird form of depression and unsatisfaction with your body as a child. When this becomes incredibly severe and you feel gender dysphoria you'll go see a therapists. This therapists will talk with you very much and will then make a diagnose. He *might* diagnose you with gender dysphoria. To treat this they will start a gender reassignment therapy *with you* (this is not something you just do on your own). After about a year he will make an evaulation determining whether or not you should start the physical treatment. The physical part of that progress mostly consists of hormones and only after *a year of that*, you'll be allowed to have surgery.




This shows that your whole premise is flawed. We don't let children just ""choose their gender"". It is a very long and complex process that goes through several phases and professional examinations.




Then about your other argument, that you could have just condensed in ""what about wrong diagnoses? They happen and are very bad!"". Yes. You are 100% correct. They happen, are really problematic and need to be talked about. However, this is a universal problem of the American Health Care system. If your entire system is build upon profit generation, don't be surprised if doctors prescribe unneccessary and even harmful treatments. 

This is not the fault of trans gender people or dysphoric people, but the fault of rich assholes who want to become even more rich by making profit of of the mental/physical health people, who are in a very bad/physical condition. The same shit happens to people with ""light"" adhd or depression getting prescribed extremely expensive medication, because the doctor has a very profitable deal with huge pharma companies.




Then to your gay-people-get-less-support-argument:

We got our rights from people who fought for it. We should not turn our backs on those people, who need *our* help now.



Also about that ""muh free speech"". Insulting people is illegal in like half of the western world and insulting people of a protected minority based on their identity is illegal in almost all of it (it is just very rarely persecuted).

g8oxwu4,g8rdyo7,"Your assessment of the paradox is very true, an example being Gandhi stating that the Jews should walk peacefully into the concentration camps in order to arouse the consciousness of the world (one must wonder what a pacifistic world was to do once aroused).  

The question is in regard to the Overton window - the range of beliefs that are deemed acceptable in society.  Is it acceptable for Nazis to speak in a public forum?  The supreme court has consistently ruled that it is.  Is it acceptable to burn the American flag?  Again, the court has been constant on this.  America has one of the largest Overton windows of any country.

I think what this article is really getting at is that liberals have recently adopted a much narrower window of acceptable beliefs.  Have you heard of any examples of pro-choice activists being shut down from speaking at universities?  There is no way to really say it without seeming (or, frankly, being) partisan - the Overton window on the left is much narrower than it is on the right.

What is really interesting, here, is how these roles have reversed over the past few decades.  Liberals used to be the party of free speech, with students at Berkeley protesting the university *not* allowing KKK members to speak on campus.  They felt they could contend with bad ideas intellectually to render them inert.  By contrast, republicans used to have an extremely narrow, often religious Overton window, with a taboo on gay marriage, women's rights, and racial integration.  While republicans today may disagree with the policies ""progressives"" put forward, and they may argue fervently against them, they really aren't trying to prevent anyone from *saying* these things.

Regarding free speech specifically, I actually don't think the paradox of tolerance should apply.  Outside of direct calls for violence and shouting fire in a movie theater, there are no ideas that people aren't allowed to say.  Beyond these specifics, there is largely nothing you aren't allowed to say.  The best way to combat speech you disagree with is more speech.  Conversation is our only tool outside of violence.  Either we talk about our differences, or we fight about them.  You can see this playing out right now with groups like antifa.  They can't convince you of their position intellectually, so they will force you physically.  A wide Overton window actually *allows* antifa to say what they believe, and this is a good thing.  With a wide window, we are able to combat their bad ideas without violence.  If the window becomes too narrow, it must be enforced with violence and it will be resisted with violence.",PoliticalDebate,1602643540.0,[deleted],,1,,jacjae,"The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.

gcpe347,gcpe3uq,[removed],PoliticalDebate,1605692750.0,[deleted],,1,,jivgqx,"U.S. capitalism solved its instability problem by making cyclical downturns afflict chiefly a minority subpart of the whole working class. It positioned that minority to bear the brunt of each cycle and suffer its damages disproportionally. That minority was repeatedly drawn into and then thrown out of jobs as the cycle dictated. Any savings it might accumulate when working would be lost when unemployed. Repeated firings precluded such a minority from enjoying the benefits of job longevity (seniority, promotion, household stability, etc.). Poverty, disrupted households and families, unaffordable housing, education, and medical care would haunt such a minority. It would become capitalism’s “business cycle shock-absorber”—the last hired, first fired—across the four-to-seven year average duration of its cycles.

Tbh it's kinda similar to my country Malaysia. In Malaysia we've been getting a lot of immigrants and since most immigrants are basically poor they will try their best to get money whether it's a penny or a dollar. Capitalist proprietors see this as a huge chance to get cheap labour and so they will hire these immigrants because they are way more cheaper than hiring the citizens of my country. And because of that my country blames the immigrants for taking our jobs even though they're just human beings trying to get a living when in actuality it's the capitalist proprietors fault.

If you didn't get that last paragraph and here's an example : James is a businessman, he owns three restaurants and two gas stations. James would usually have to pay his workers 1k per month cuz if he doesn't do so his workers would just bail and quit. This frustrates James because it means he has to pay a sum of money. Until one day James's country was taking a lot of immigrants. These immigrants were very poor and needed money. They would take any job for even if the wage was low. James saw this as an absolute chance to get cheap labour. So James decided to  hire the immigrants . Because these immigrants don't care how low of a wage they'll get as long as its money, James decides that his worker's monthly wage should be the minimum wage that is set in his country. And because of that, most citizens in James's country doesn't want to work for him cuz he'll end up giving them the minimum wage which is something that they don't like. Because a chef deserves more money than the minimum wage. This also sadden James's ex-workers. But instead of blaming James, they blame the immigrants.

It's because decades ago a monopolistic, guild-infested professional class achieved massive regulatory capture at both the State and Federal level, resulting in barriers to market entry, i.e., a choke-hold on the supply of healthcare.

It hasn't helped that government programs, including both Medicare and the WWII wage ceilings that produced employer-sponsored healthcare, have artificially forced up demand.

The natural result of this has been skyrocketing prices.  Everything else has been people blindly scrambling around a problem they don't understand.  How else to explain an ""Affordable"" Care Act that forced up demand even further, without touching the choked-off supply, and therefore raised prices *even more*?

Your proposal seems like a great way to increase competition by encouraging price shopping.  I'm wondering what the difference is between health insurance and other kinds of insurance though.  I've never heard a proposal for the government to (effectively) provide life or homeowner's insurance, but I've heard a lot of proposals for it to provide medical insurance.  In theory, the market should be able to provide insurance more efficiently than the government, right?  The market has a stronger incentive to reduce overhead costs etc.  But maybe this is a special case?  What are your thoughts?",PoliticalDebate,1603988536.0,Ben69420,,2,,jk3x60,"I'm from Australia which has social healthcare (Medicare) alongside private health insurance. And I *hate* it. Either you get free care with lower quality and long wait times (2 years wait to get a child with learning difficulties seen) or you pay for private care. You can choose two methods, both with strong drawbacks but you never get the best of both worlds as advocates of universal healthcare claim. It's actually quite classist which is the opposite of what it's supposed to be.

I like the idea of everyone having access to healthcare but I don't like that a lot of the proposals remove price signals as well as competition in the marketplace. Prices are an important signal to regulate the allocation of resources - high prices draw more people into providing that service.

My idea for healthcare is that for most procedures (not including emergencies) maybe we could ditch the entire insurance system and just have the government pay people the median cost of that procedure for that state. The patient can choose a cheaper provider and pocket the difference, or a more expensive provider and foot the difference.

The doctors can set their price but people would shop around for the best doctor, for the best price, for the best timeframe, that suits them. This would introduce price signal and competition into the system and drive down costs (which would result in lower median price for each treatment over time).

For emergencies, the patient would just get taken to the closest Hospital and the Doctor would simply get the median price of the procedure for that state.",Boronthemoron,,1,,1603978000.0,[deleted],[deleted],,10,1603947114.0

But I am still hopeful I can give some insight that can help, so all I'm gonna say is: I live in a country where universal health care is a thing, even for non-nationals. People living at the border in neighboring countries often cross the border to get treatment in our hospitals and then go back to their countries, free of charge.

Both ""right"" and ""left"" can be formidable in their own ways. I'm going to assume that you already understand that left and right is poorly interpreted by politicians and media, because in reality it represents economical theories being Socialism vs Capitalism.

The **Auth-Right** is often characterized by Nazism, a fascist regime, who were *extremely* authoritarian. America is not a fascist state, at least not yet, largely due to a large understanding of the constitution which was written to protect individuals.

Historically America was far more libertarian than Authoritative as we are today. This is due to the constitution at writing failing to recognize that the government could expand it's own powers, which it did grossly throughout the 20th century with starting with FDR and continued to do so through today.

Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party both in-fact are in the Authoritarian-Right side of the political compass. This is important to recognize because basically due to the growth of paternalistic beliefs, especially on a federal level, our country has gone into a more Authoritative state. We're doing even more so with identity politics which is highly destructive of the original philosophies during the writing of the constitution of individualism.

The Nazi party's fascist ideals again were extremely authoritative, much beyond we are. The more paternalistic policies we pursue the less liberties we have, even when claimed to be in the interest of other's liberties. While being Authoritative, the Nazi party was more capitalistic which means they leaned slightly to the right.

It's important to address something here, about the word *fascism*. Many want to say that because fascism is something that was birthed largely by Nazi's that is must have their right leaning economics. This is a terrible statement because cases like Leninism shared fascist ideals, where they repressed and killed dissenting opinions and individuals however held a socialist economic theory. Lenin and Marxism were **Auth-Left**.

There's another term for a more modern approach of fascism, which I totally have been using too much lately, where individuals don't necessarily utilize the same tactics against those that disagree with you as like historical fascists did such as murder - *parafascism*. Where the prefix para- means in Greek ""beyond, past, by"", translating to boiled down version of fascism: *repression of dissenting opinions.* It's exactly what fascists did, it's exactly what's happening in media, on Twitter with the censorship, and generally much of modern politics with the current 'cancel-culture'.

Not only do we need to be careful about the government censoring people, we need to be careful about laissez-faire capitalism allowing companies to censor people. Including individuals being able to censoring each other.

You should not be worried about auth-right or auth-left, you should be worried about those that have authority over you and also ideological extremists (extremes being ends of the political compass - Totalitarianism, Anarchy, Laissez-Faire Capitalism, and Communism.)

He wants to build onto affordable healthcare to make it better. 

He wants to build new green industry (I'm hoping he gives those jobs to areas that have a lot of fracking, so that way we can transition out of fracking one day but not have those people lose their jobs). Not sure if this is going to happen though, we'll see.

I expect Covid to be a big thing until Biden is inaugurated. After inauguration, he'll put in place a draconian lockdown for 4 -8 weeks with a massive bailout. He'll then have a nationwide mandatory mask order for at least 2 months. The D's will do everything in their power to thwart any kind of economic or market recoveries while Trump is in office so they can take full credit for it in 2021.

While all this is going on, Covid messaging from the Neo-Goebbels media will turn more positive. 

After the first two months, Biden will declare victory over C19 but want us to be careful. 

Life will return to normal.

Business owners like myself will pay higher taxes and higher regulatory burden costs. 

But the economy will grow(as it has nowhere else to go but up). But it will be a tepid growth similar to what we saw after Obama took office after the great recession (don't hit me with a bunch of political and economic malarky please. Your side, be gracious about it).

The D's will try and reign in their radical progressive wing, and will be somewhat successful at it. But it's too late for that. The US is on a non-stop train to Democratic Socialism in the next 10 - 20 years. 

Both the Democrat powers that be and the progressive powers that be don't want to hamstring the US economy too much as it is the engine that drives the world because, contrary to what the progressives tell you, the US form of capitalism, although flawed, is the greatest wealth building machine in history and they want control over it. Control over the means of production will be used to enrich the cronies of the winners of the US versions of ""Political Game of Thrones"" (that is a metaphor, so please don't flame me). 

Of course, the winner of said game will toss a few bones to the useful idiots that will continue to support it (and were on the winning side of ""progressive war for power""). 

The US, being a strong nation will take at least 3 generations of this BS to grow the balls to stand up and revolt against said powers that be.

This was one of those ""midshower thoughts""



I would like to say I like this idea becuase its reliance on markets as pricing mechanisms.  Free from subsidy or welfare. Goods and services provided purely by their value to the consumer. 

It also respects the true nature of labor. Since the 13th ammendment here in the US at least. No individual has been involved in the labor market that they didnt willingly sign onto.

I reject the Marxist notion that the owner of capital in the world steal surplus value from their labor for the capitalists profit.

I reject this becuase every single one of his laborers is there of their own free will, engaged in selling their marketable skills for the highest possible value they can achieve.

I find the idea of a government playing favorites,  either pro buisness,  or pro-union in an attempt to right some percieved  social imbalance,  as inherrintly flawed.

Well the rhethorical reply to this would be:

""Do you think everyone is capable of being rationally altruistic""?

I dont have visions of ancap leading to utopia. Simply it being the most possible fair system.

To the shopping cart point. People are infact acting in their best interest becuase it isnt worth their time to return it.

But let us hypothesize a store policy by which you had to put down a $50 deposit for the privilege of using one of the stores carts. How many people would return a cart in this scenario? Most would I would wager.

Of course the collective dialogue that is the market has decided its in everyone's best interest if the store allows the customer to use their carts for free as a courtesy, and pay someone to go and pick them up.",PoliticalDebate,1606093137.0,[deleted],,1,,jz6v56,"The only reason I'm not an ancap is because I don't think everyone is capable of being rationally self interested.

How many people do you know can take personal responsibility for even simple things? Want to test this? Go sit in a grocery store parking lot and see how many people actually put the carriage into the collection area when they're done. A task as simple as that will demonstrate how so many people are incapable of taking personal responsibility.

It's not new, and the stuff about Hillary was true and needed to be known.
Here's more
 Bush didn't go after al qaeda in saudi arabia because of the bundling dinners where he received money from Saudi Arabia and even gave arms indirectly to alqueda (Obama did that too) through sending arms to saudi arabia, he took money from defense contractors which further influenced the decision, which all the people in washington saw and still voted to give him the power to start a war without congress, one of the people who essentially voted for that war being Biden. 

Also, the Russian collusion isn't founded in reality, saudi arabia, isreal, and defense contractors had more influence on him just like every other president before him since nixon, which is why we didn't prosecute on those things.

We lose relations with north korea and make a trigger happy fat asian dude the middle finger, we continue the drone war and possibly expand it, we won't get a stimulus bill unless it is completely watered down in a time where unemployment and homelessness is going to be worse than the great depression, he only settles on ansular issues because he knows he gets brownie points for them and doesn't need to conceed on anything and doesn't believe in anything.

Sweden is close to hyper capitalistic to pay for those things, all those things are supported by our high taxes except for the vacation part which is roughly done by taking what you would earn in 11 months and you pay it out over 12 months instead.

We have moved closer and closer to private healthcare, and private schools, we used to have both things done by the state but it was inefficient, slow and very expensive. We pay roughly 60% of what we earn in taxes through various means.

Sweden did try socialism in the past, and it was still an ongoing attempt in the 80s when i was born, and we were dirt poor. For example we didnt have hot water in our schools because it was to expensive, taxes was insane so my two parents could barely just feed 4 people, my mother and father and me and my sister and we lived in a small shitty 3 room appartment. My father is an electrical engineer and my mother is specialized in healthcare, taxes were insane back then, roughly 75-80%. Socialism doesnt work its hell on earth. If you want to experience real socialism i suggest you visit north korea or Venezuela. We in Sweden just had socialism lite you could call it i guess. Have you heard about the group Abba, if you watch some of their videos you will see what kind of pants they are wearing, do you know why they are wearing those pants? Its not because of fashion, its because they werent taxed. Ingemar Bergman Swedens famous director had to flee Sweden because he had to pay 102% taxes, when he made money he got poorer. Our famous childrens books author Astrid Lindgren, had to stop writing books because she couldnt afford to sell more books.

Socialism doesnt work, and it can never work, we are more capitalistic then the USA is today, we dont have any minimum wage laws yet wages are high, its so easy to start a business anyone can do it, you basically just fill out a form and then you are done. We dont have an FDA for example, so when an aquantaince of me decided to open a sushi restaurant all he had to do was fill out a form and then he was done.

Leftists don't want to ban guns.

Obviously even Reagan and Clinton didn't want to ban guns entirely and that's mostly a straw man used entirely for NRA advertisements, because no one would join the NRA if they didn't keep insisting that your guns are one election away from confiscation.

It doesn't matter who you call if you're being robbed.

If your home is invaded while you are in it, you can fight, hide, or comply until the home invaders leave. After the home invaders leave or are subdued, the police will show up and either write an insurance claim, shoot your dog, or arrest you, depending on your skin color. 

Banning guns and police is actually an oxymoronic fear, because if law enforcement actually ceased to exist, laws banning guns would be meaningless.

You actually might be right that not every single political ideology within a country is putting the interests of a country first. But what I meant is that when people say that they need to put their country first, they mean putting, or claiming to put, the citizens of said country first. Nationalism is just that tho, you'll be put first but it's not clear how they'll do it. All the other ideologies don't have to say that the citizens will be put first since their goal is to improve the lives of the citizens and they can explain how and why they are in the right.

I would argue that monarchism is a form of a nationalism. National pride/prestige and whatnot.

Nationalism is a slippery slope. The hate starts with immigrants who don't integrate, to immigrants who do integrate just because they weren't born there and don't share the same blood as the founding fathers, to actual citizens who just don't share the same ideology as them (if you're not a nationalist, you're an enemy).

He does mention it, and explains how they're different.

Communism didn't come from workers, but intellectuals. That's just a fact.

Fascism also doesn't come from ""the big bad evil capitalists"" either. It often comes from ex-military, and intellectuals. Capitalists are far more confortable in a liberal society than in a fascist one. 

&gt;""They both threaten our liberty and democracy"". Neither the US nor Germany are very democratic or are a 'beacon of liberty'. That is a bad take to appeal for emotions.

What nations are more liberal and democratic than liberal democracies ? If you're going to cite socialist countries, I genuinely think we can't really talk without wasting both your time and mine.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You can't just debate Nazis in the free market place of ideas

You can, and it's really easy to do so because their ideas are trash. You know how they gain tolerance or even support from the middle class ? They need to be terrified of the far left, which is what happened in 1920's Italy and the Weimar republic. The Alt-right didn't pop up in out of nowhere, they arose in response to the normalization of far-left rhetoric that directly goes against liberal principles (The whole ""SJW response video"" genre was a huge component of the Alt-right radicalization method). They radicalized young people (especially boys) by being the only voice to openly oppose the far-left. 

It's not about far-left violence being as bad, worse or better than far-right violence.

It's about the fact that when the far left violates social order and people's rights, fascists use it to reassure people that their violations of social order and people's rights are necessary because ""Democracy has failed"" (which was quite a popular alt-right slogan).

When Philosophy Tube asks the question ""How do we define who's a fascist ? / Far Right ?"" he answers it with ""That's not a very useful question""

This is very telling (to the point that back when I watched the video I almost closed the tab) because if the goal was fighting fascism you'd want to have a solid definition of it. He's basically telling viewers that fighting fascism is an excuse and/or a way to feel righteous, the rest of the video is him saying that far-left violence - which he implicitely admits is arbitrary - is preferable to far right violence because ""at least we're not racist"", and therefore should be accepted because ""otherwise far right violence will erupt"", which is the exact manipulation than the alt-right uses.

Once again, are fascists worse than revolutionary communists ? Yes. But that's not what I disagree with. 

What I disagree with is the idea that there's no way to protect ourselves against fascism other than either having either a left-wing dictatorship or letting far-left extremists be judges, juries and executioners with no legal or moral accountability. 

My point is also that the threat of the authoritarian left - which, no, doesn't leave anyone who's not a nazi alone - reinforces and outright validates far-right ideas about civilization decline, the necessity of totalitarianism and the urgency thereof. Which reinforces the idea that left-wing totalitarianism is necessary, emboldening people to be arbitrarily violent, etc. 

The idea that the far left doesn't go against people's peaceful existence and leaves people alone if they stop being nazis is also becoming less and less true with the rise of critical theory, which, on constructivist grounds, makes every element of being of someone in a ""dominant group"" an act of agression, including existence itself. The ""White silence is violence"" slogan is a perfect example of this.",PoliticalDebate,1610542173.0,Gaveyard,,-1,,kwe7dj,"A pretty bad video tbh.

Then the ""fastists come from fascists, communists comes from communists take"". This surprises me, coming from someone who I think is German, as we usually learn about this more in school, and he should know better. Communists don't come from communists, they come from workers. When you have a large of workers, you'll find communists there (at least in Germany). The idea that it came up by itself is quite short-sighted. The idea of fascism just coming up by itself is even more short-sighted and potentially extremely dangerous, as fascism rises from capitalists (the economic class) giving right-wing extremists huge loads of money, because they are scared about workers' movements. 


""They both threaten our liberty and democracy"". Neither the US nor Germany are very democratic or are a 'beacon of liberty'. That is a bad take to appeal for emotions.


'Both bad because both are violent'. I'd recommend philosophy tube's video about antifa for a more in-depth explanation but to make it more short; in modern times, right-wing extremists target lgbt people, non-white racial groups and muslims. Left-wing extremists target *right-wing extremists*. The difference is obvious, as you can't choose to not be gay, but you can choose to stop being a right-wing activist. To praphrase the video I mentioned:

""When you are a target of left-wing extremism, you can drop the activism and antifa will let you alone. They wont be your friends, but they'll move on. When you are a target of right-wing extremism, either they lose or you *die*.""


Also, and as a fellow German this annoys me in particular, you can't just debate Nazis in the free market place of ideas. I, and he probably too, went through three years of history class about how and why the Nazis came to power, he has to know better. First of all, you can't politely disagree with someones existance; the idea that a gay person should just debate a raging homophobe calmly and without insults is ridiculous, because the homophobes position is already extremely insulting and oftentimes leading to violence. Also, Nazis don't seek  debate. Their ideas are not based on rational observations, they are based on irrational scapegoating. If the jewish people had not existed in the 1930s, the nazis would have made them up, because they need this group to blame everything up. Change ""jewish people"" to ""globalists"" and ""the 1930s"" to ""2010s"", and you see that american fascism does the same.

gmywlfg,gmz0a5n,"Well for the Bernie example, I’m not sure I see the connection to this. Bernie didn’t say or do anything that could reasonably be seen as inciting the man to pull the trigger or engage in violence in that instance.

As for the first amendment thing, I agree mostly, but it seems to me that that shouldn’t hold true when your words incite others to violence. Trump saying the election was stolen was ridiculous and awful, but he has the right to say that. He doesn’t have the right to incite people to action based on that, if the actions he’s trying to incite involve violence. At least that’s my understanding.

Sure he did say to march to the capitol and peacefully make your voices heard, but for months and in the speech that day as well he used lots of fiery language about fighting like hell and having to show strength. So if we’re looking at the totality of the language he used surrounding the issue, there was at least as much to suggest aggressive action if not more so. Also I do believe intent can be inferred, and the fact that Trump didn’t take more forceful action to stop the insurrection, was reportedly very giddy about it, and first call he made over an hour into the ordeal was to a senator asking them to push further on fraud as opposed to checking on the VP or anyone else’s safety seems pretty damning in terms of what he truly wanted to happen, or at the very least what he considered his priorities.",PoliticalDebate,1613071105.0,GFK96,,1,,lhrdr3,"Lying while in office in not against the constitution.  Obama did it when he said you can keep your doctor with his healthcare, Bush did it concerning nukes in the Middle East, Trump lied about the election results.  So what?  This is all protected free speech.  You cannot convict somebody for a lie.  That is one of the reasons why the first amendment exists.  

As for incitement, he sure didn’t help himself, but you can’t really say he encouraged violence explicitly either.  That being beyond a reasonable doubt.  Especially when a quote during his speech is “we are going to march to the capitol and we are going to do it peacefully.”  In addition to that fact, if you lower “incitement” to that level in order to convict Trump, you could then put 15-20 senators on trial for breaching the same level of incitement in the past.  Most notably Maxine Waters calling for people to “get up and form a crowd” around her political opponents if seen in public, would reach the level in of impeachment.

Overall, if you are going to say that politicians are responsible for the fringe actions of their followers, things like Bernie being put on trial for the attempted murder of Steve Scalise would be a thing.  Since a Bernie Bro tried to assassinate a Republican while being inspired by a politician.  Which is dumb.  I don’t blame Bernie for that.  It’s just a slippery slope.

All it would take for me to change my mind is a single instance of Trump explicitly inciting violence with a sentence like “they stole the election, go to the capitol, and commit violence to stop the steal.”  But nothing like that was ever said.

Government is a corporation (for arguments sake)

It’s really just another institution works much the same way, accept the goal of those in it, is to keep their power in.

Over reach of power by any corporate entity (including government) is what creates fascism.

Capitalism isn’t any different other than the goal is money, instead of constitutional authority (and money can accomplish the same if not more)

We still have military contractors and weapons manufacturers pushing us into regime change wars...to leach off the tax dollars they’re paid when it happens.

You have pharma who’s negotiated their own monopolies on every drug they produce, and allow them to make the slightest alterations, so they claim “wait we’re not done innovating so we deserve monopolistic pricing to hold sick people for ransom as the only supplier”

That one is particularly awful to me because it’s anti-free market. And by design, gives consumers the worst aspects of both capitalism and socialism

It’s capitalism in that no one cares if you can afford it. But socialist in that the government stops others from making the product and selling for cheaper...

It’s all corporate entities. 

The only way to go in the opposite direction, is to always push for decentralization of power.

Both left and right just use different vectors to consolidate power and Capital. Both work against the people

The only way people have a greater voice is if you decentralize power and Capital in the private and public sectors

This source is almost ten years old, but the trends are worth noting: 

 

&gt;The gap between whites and blacks in average longevity declined significantly over the past century ([**Figure 3**](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL32792.html#_Ref194285325)). For *females*, the improving situation for black women relative to their white counterparts was dramatic and mostly consistent throughout the century. From the height of the differential in 1904—when white women survived, on average, 17.9 years longer than black women—the gap fell to 4.4 years in 2003.  
&gt;  
&gt;A significant reduction in the life expectancy gap between American white and black *men* was also observed over the 20th century. From its height of 17.8 years in 1904, the differential had fallen to 6.3 years in 2003. The improvement was most rapid in the first six decades of the past century. Since the mid-1950s, however, improvements for males have stagnated in the range of roughly 6.0 to 8.5 years. While the male gap has been falling over the past decade, this trend obscures the fact that the differential had already been at or near this level for most of the mid-1950s to mid-1960s. The gap in 1961 was narrower than that observed today—at that time, the gap between white and black men was 5.8 years (as compared to 6.3 \[in 2003\]).

As for the roots of systemic racism, i'd offer that there might be too many to mention. The main ones tho IMHO are the historical prevalence of xenophobia - the fact that until passenger airplanes became available, migration or even travel could not compare with the levels we find today. Also, traditionally social groups were far smaller and closer-knit than in modern day, so exposure to other cultures was extremely limited. I would also assume that inclusivity (in terms of social norms and government policy) was never really incentivised on a major scale until the advent of modern liberalism.

What concerns the virus I do agree that their inititial reaction was quite shitty, I don't think they intentionally released it though, if that's what you're hinting at. Also let's be fair many governments initial reaction was far from stellar.

The treatment of the Uyghurs alone would warrant a boycott in my opinion. The thing is that the US itself has done worse in the name of the war on terror (which is the same justification the Chinese use). So maybe if both countries boycott eachother both get what they deserve? I fear in the end the people will be punished more than the governments though which wouldn't really help.

I'm aware that... to certain people... racism, fascism, white supremacy, dating your sister, flying the Confederate flag, and owning a pickup truck are all the same thing, but since we're here, let's try using the right words. 

Fascists do not automatically build concentration camps... for instance. That is in no way a requirement for fascism. Italians were fascists and they had no problems with Jews until 1938 when Germany basically pressured them into doing something about the ""Jewish problem"". Even then, their efforts were [mild by comparison](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/italy)..

&gt;Fascism is not a political stance, but rather the political expression of a direct offensive from the state towards the working class. Therefore, fascism cannot be debated, only fought.

Now I don't actually believe the alt-Right is fascist, but rather neofascist and that difference is important. The main difference is that fascist methodologies are related to *direct offensive* (think concentration camps), while neofascism takes an indirect approach (think empowering police forces to target minorities).

As such, the alt-Right and neofascist movements all around the world are harder to pin down. I *would* say that disregarding strategy or tactics, neofascism stands for pretty much the same that fascism stood for back in the day, and that I wouldn't be surprised if neofascists, should they achieve their horrifying goals, would end up supporting direct offensives making them indistinguishable from proper Nazis, which would mean that as you originally proposed, the alt-Right is not a valid political ideology. But I couldn't swear my life on it, because the former are things I *believe they would do in a specific scenario* or *things I think they think deep down*, which are both speculative. I guess it's a case-by-case kind of thing, and depends on which values are driving the subject to the alt-Right.

17. Entirely subjective. If you have a way to categorise charisma into a series of unbiased and clear categories, tell me.
18. So like how his supporters stormed the capitol because Trump refused to acknowledge the election results? Is that bringing a country together? Are his 	attacks on the media bringing the country together? Are his continual spread of lies and false statements bringing the country together?
19. Can you show how that happened?

I understand that this sub is based off of classical debate, I'm not talking about not being able to present a statement as a motion of debate, I'm talking about presenting them in a way that seems plausible that a debate can stem from that.

Titles that use axiological or emotional terms rather than descriptive ones are likely to drive this sub into partisanship: people with different points of views will often think that no serious debate can stem from that but rather a toxic screamer, which ultimately drives users from different points of view away from the community.

1. Literally every other political sub you can do what you're asking. You can make everything ""what do you guys feel about this or that"". They're all shitshows of partisan politics, personal attacks, and in no way resemble a respectful and constructive debate platform. 
2. Debate requires opposing positions. Simply asking questions and having them answered isn't necessarily a debate. It might offer some stimulating conversation but the idea was to push toward more of a cross ex style debate or Lincoln Douglas style debate, which brings us to:
3. The sub is based off of classical debate. One side provides the affirmative and is responsible for presenting a case supporting their resolution. Opposing viewpoints must then present a counter argument or attack the support of the OP. The default is, if the case is not proven, then the affirmative fails. If the case is reasonably proven, but then defeated, the affirmative fails. Only if the case is proven and overcomes attack by the negative, does the resolution pass.

Where people from both sides look for common ground and discuss potential action that serves the interests of populists on both sides...

On example maybe, partly replacing income tax with carbon tax

As increased ppm does ad risk to everyone’s life, so it seems reasonable we have our gov tax them for it

Income tax on the other hand, economically, is a direct discouragement from working. Simply because you’re being charged simply for working to survive...why would we choose to disincentivize that? Especially with lower income brackets?

Just to name an example",PoliticalDebate,1617642161.0,antifrgl01,,1,,mkbf0t,"The reasons that the rules and format chosen are the format for the sub thus far are as follows: 

1. Literally every other political sub you can do what you're asking. You can make everything ""what do you guys feel about this or that"". They're all shitshows of partisan politics, personal attacks, and in no way resemble a respectful and constructive debate platform. 
2. Debate requires opposing positions. Simply asking questions and having them answered isn't necessarily a debate. It might offer some stimulating conversation but the idea was to push toward more of a cross ex style debate or Lincoln Douglas style debate, which brings us to:
3. The sub is based off of classical debate. One side provides the affirmative and is responsible for presenting a case supporting their resolution. Opposing viewpoints must then present a counter argument or attack the support of the OP. The default is, if the case is not proven, then the affirmative fails. If the case is reasonably proven, but then defeated, the affirmative fails. Only if the case is proven and overcomes attack by the negative, does the resolution pass.

gv9hult,gvangdu,"&gt;Are you suggesting that the well being of all humans is negatively impacted by hierarchies because when the necessary greater number of humans at the bottom look up, they're less happy? 

That is part of it, yes. As an easy example, if you live in a small house next to a massive villa, you will naturally be less content with what you have, regardless of how many of your needs it objectively satisfies

&gt;Are we equating happiness with well being? Some things will make me happy, being lazy all day and eating junk food, but they're not necessarily good for my well being.

I would argue that while being lazy for a day might be beneficial to you in the short term, its long-term consequences might not be as desirable to you.

&gt;Being in a situation where you look up and desire more, can motivate individuals, and even small gains toward the top can have positive effects on the well being of an individual.

I'd argue that there are ways this can be achieved without relying on hierarchies of power. For example, you may look of to a particularly talented artist, scientist or artisan solely based on the admiration of their craft. You may also look at a coworker who is exceedingly productive and receives some kind of unique reward for it. Remember, what I am advocating for is not the abolition of all hierarchy, it's the promotion of looking for less hierarchical alternatives to what we currently have.

Additionally, we have to consider the fact that to most people, rising up the hierarchy is a statistical impossibility. Since hierarchies such as wealth are distributed according to a power law, they naturally create an outcome at which most people find themselves at the bottom of it.

&gt;Additionally, taking into account the people at the top, have you considered the Matthew effect?

I wasn't familiar with the term before, but isn't that what I was talking about when I mentioned the snowball effect of power? If not, I'm sorry but you will have to elaborate.",PoliticalDebate,1618985255.0,Asato_of_Vinheim,,1,,mv0l7a,"Are you suggesting that the well being of all humans is negatively impacted by hierarchies because when the necessary greater number of humans at the bottom look up, they're less happy?

I would also call into question how huge of an external incentive brilliant minds even need to pursue excellence in their fields. Scientists, artists and artisans often seem to be motivated primarily by their craft itself rather than the potential monetary rewards they may or may not be granted.

Additionally, there are ways in which hierarchy even stands in the way of invention. An easy example would be our education system. If every child was giving high-quality education, we would see a massive increase in scientific and artistic advancements once those students enter adulthood.

So what does hierarchies do for us? Well it lets you know which brain surgeon is the best one for example, it lets you know which heart surgeons are very good at performing the open heart surgery that you need in order to live. But these two examples doesnt tell the whole story of why hierarchies are important.

Hierarchies stem from how we value other people in some regard, what they are good at what they arent so good at. You call a plumber and they send out a guy to fix your stuff, he fixes it but causes a number of different problems, so you call the company and complain, they send a new plumber out and he fixes the new problems but the old problem returned, so you call them again. You get to talk to the manager and he says ""i will send the best plumber i have to fix your problem but he is busy today, so i will ask him to fix your problem tomorrow does 10am work for you?"" You talk back and forth a little bit about the job, and he says ""by the way the plumber im sending is excellent at the job but he is a little weird.""

He is at the top of the plumbing hierarchy in that company, even though he is weird.

We utilize hierarchies as well in the modern world, almost everyone here has a boss right. Well he is responsible that the work gets done on time, he has to utilize the employees under him in such a way that the job gets done on time, and if that fails you as an employee is not blamed, your boss will be. In order for him to do a good job he also has the ability to tell you what you should do. That is how we utilize hierarchies in the modern world.

Hierarchies has always existed and the least hierarchical societies on the planet are those in the capitalist countries because people are free and they have options. If your boss tells you to do something you dont like all you have to do is say ""no i wont do it"" and there is nothing he can do about it, except fire you. But there are other jobs out there, and there might not be so easy for him to find a new employee that will be willing to do that job and he needs that job done now.

Hierarchies are what feeds you, because those farmers who were bad at farming had to stop because they got out competed by other farmers who were more productive, which in turn means that the food you buy is even cheaper and more plentiful at the same time.

Do you want hierarchies to have a say in who is the pilot of the plane you are about to go on? Do you want hierarchies to have a say in who will do a root canal on you? Do you want hierarchies to supply you with cheap food of good quality or do you prefer expensive food with poor quality?

Do you want hierarchies to make sure that your electricity works, or are you happy with whoever setting up your electricity in your home?

Do you want hierarchies to give you a good meal when you go to a restaurant, or would you be happy with a random bloke from the street preparing your meal? I mean it will be a rather shitty meal at a high price.

gvl4qwy,gvlakvx,"&gt;1. Not all education is equal, which is why people bother paying for it. By weeding people out, the idea is that a percentage of those people are going to be there because they deserve to be in the highest form of education offered. A percentage, not all, so don't bother arguing that some are there because of other reasons. 

That's just not how the education system works, nor would it be optimal if it worked that way. To substantiate the former, I simply need to point at the fact that children who visit private schools are going there thanks to the achievements of their parents, not because of their own merits.

As for the latter, let's for the sake of the argument assume that we could somehow measure the inherent intellectual potential of humans. Why would we now suddenly stop benefitting from those at the lower end of this distribution receiving less support? There is plenty of inellectual labour which doesn't require you to be at the peak of human intellect, and especially innovation tends to be something which also incorporates other aspects such as creativity, passion or life experience. Your argument looks at the fact that we benefit more from the support given to those with high potential, while completely ignoring that we still benefit from educating everyone else as well.

&gt;2. The concept is that those with ability have already at least risen partially out of poverty on the power of their own motivation. Additionally you alleviate some or most of this with the programs that target those with aptitude and offer scholarships that include stipends. 

This ignores the second half of my argument. By raising children in an impoverished environment, you harm their development and make it less likely for them to develop said abilities. In addition to that, there is no guarantee that an impoverished genius would find the time, resources and most of all luck that is required to even bother with rising up the social hierarchy.

&gt;3. This is a terrible idea because it completely removes any incentive to produce. Your ideas can instantly be stolen and credit taken by those who have better means of production. You get no credit in society, you have no motivation, this will actually actively work to make people lazy instead of motivated to produce innovative solutions. 

This assumes that there is competition. I advocate for a decentrally planned economy under democratic control, hence why I was explicitly talking about the downsides of competition.

Your incentive to produce would be your social contract, which necessitates you to productively contribute to society in an adequate manner as a condition for receiving access to society's resources. Of course a planning council could also decide to offer additional rewards for those who are especially productive, which I would be in favour of.

The incentive to innovate will be passion, need and recognition. This leads back to what I started my post with. Additionally, those who are capable to consistently provide high quality research and innovation would of course be able to just do that as their primary occupation, similar to how nowdays we have R&amp;D staff employed in both the public and the private sector.

&gt;4. Socialism coined the phrase ""they pretend to pay us, we pretend to work"" so I'm not certain that this where you want to make your stand. Arguably socialism is worse at raising working standards because capitalism has more at stake if your workers decide to walk off the job and go work for your competitor who's bothered to clear out all the Badgers and Bears from the factory floor before work hours. Under capitalism no one is stuck doing anything, it's entirely voluntary.

I advocate for freedom of association and democracy. I don't know why you would use the example of the Soviet Union without first verifying whether the things you are going to critique actually apply to what I am proposing, but it doesn't really show me that you are approaching this discussion in good faith.

&gt;The only way you get ""stuck"" is to not find anything better.

Which is a reality plenty of people find themselves in. When you work 40 hour weeks in a grueling and alienating environment just to make ends meet, it's fairly difficult to then use the little time you have left of your day to change your occupation.

&gt;Having doctors sweep the streets is a misuse of resources and lowers morale for doctors.

Not at all. It would give doctors a greater sense of belonging and responsibility, at least depending on the exact type of doctor. Of course people who perform labour which there is a surplus of demand for or whose occuparion is already too taxing to allow for anything more would be excluded from this rule.

&gt;5. You can do this under capitalism or fascism. 

To do this you require a lot of funding which the working class simply doesn't have access to under capitalism. You would need massive tax rates for capital owners, corporations and the wealthy in general to properly implement this idea on a larger scale. Fascism and other types of mixed economies would be able to do it, but I of course have plenty of other issues with these systems. If you advocate for any type of mixed economy and are interested, we could get into those later.

&gt;6. Not every innovative scenario requires betting your life savings on it, and this can also be mitigated by certain outreach programs and educational programs. It is as well.

Hence why I named nations with a lot of social programs as an example for this idea already working in praxis.

&gt;Just... historically inaccurate. First, there's not been a socialist country that could stand without help from a capitalist country. So the existence of what we're calling socialism right now is predicated on the guns and blood of capitalist nations surrounding them with a bubble of implicit and explicit force and political pressure. 

Every existing socialist nation has been under ruthless attack from the capitalist world. I'm really not sure from where you have this idea that past socialist experiments had to rely on the support of the capitalist world. The closest example I could think of in this regard is how Rojava had to rely on the US to keep Turkey at bay.

I responded to this point last because, even if it was true, it simply wouldn't be relevant unless you can name socialist societies which actually adhered to the values I advocate for AND failed out of entirely internal reasons.",PoliticalDebate,1619200110.0,Asato_of_Vinheim,,2,,mwz9wc,"Just... historically inaccurate.

But taking that aside, I don't think the argument is that all innovation would cease without capitalism (more specifically, competition). So before I go point by point here, let me say that competition is the actual driving force, not capitalism which is simply one form of it.

That's not socialism. 

1. A free market in education will increase quality of education and lower prices. The reason education costs so much is because of government subsidies in higher education. Private school are routinely cheaper per student and provide better education.

https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/education/private-school-cost-vs-public-school/

2. The best way to do this is to encourage small business development in low income and poverty stricken areas. We need relaxed zoning laws, the end of the drug war, and start reallocation welfare funding to low or no interest business loans or even grants in these areas. Socialism won't solve that problem, as capitalism is what maximizes economic growth. 

3. I agree to a point. Definitely need a reform here, but I'm not sure if this really inhibits innovation though. 

4. This can be done under capitalism, and the best way to start is by teaching people all the things motivational speakers teach people that so many dismiss. First, when one is a worker, you are the product. You're selling your skills and time, make yourself worthwhile. The job interviewer is the buyer. Second, do something you love. 40 hours a week is not much at all, and there is plenty of time to do hobbies and other things if what you love doesn't make money. Third, be healthy. Eating correctly and exercising has a ton of benefits, including improved attitude. There was an experiment done where people working in a factory did vote on every decision made. I believe this was in South America. What ended up happening was that people stopped showing up for the votes, because it turned many people didn't know how to contribute, and they ended up with the same structure as before. And not everyone can do every job. Ignoring educational requirements for certain jobs, it would be wildly inefficient.

gvl6k99,gvnsviz,"&gt;1. A free market in education will increase quality of education and lower prices. The reason education costs so much is because of government subsidies in higher education. Private school are routinely cheaper per student and provide better education. 

Both of your sources fail to prove the point. Source one does a bunch of unsupported claims and then goes on to name Germany as an example where public education has failed. Well, as a German who goes to a public college while paying less per semester than I have to pay for monthly rent, I find this claim laughable. Naturally, the article doesn't bother supporting this claim either.

As for the second source, it completely ignore the fact that private schools still receive government funding per student, meaning that naturally the student won't have to pay the full price of their educarion. It also ignores the fact that all the cheapest private schools are religious schools, meaning that there is a strong correlation between religiousity and low tuition fees which is entirely unrelated to whether or not private schools are more efficient.

Both of those factors considered, it follows that the already very close advantage private schools ***appear*** to have over public schools tell us next to nothing about their actual efficiency.

&gt;3. This can be done under capitalism, and the best way to start is by teaching people all the things motivational speakers teach people that so many dismiss. First, when one is a worker, you are the product. You're selling your skills and time, make yourself worthwhile. The job interviewer is the buyer.

Then I would ask why companies currently don't seem to be very good at achieving this. Getting your employees to be more motivated and feel less alienated by their labour seems rather profitable in the long run, yet it seems as though only high-paying jobs even attempt something like this.

I'd also argue that selling your labour time is an inherently alienating act (https://www.grin.com/document/213748). Making workers more aware that this is in fact what they are doing might very well have the opposite of your desires effect.

&gt;There was an experiment done where people working in a factory did vote on every decision made. I believe this was in South America. What ended up happening was that people stopped showing up for the votes, because it turned many people didn't know how to contribute, and they ended up with the same structure as before.

There has been more than just one experiment. There is an entire type of business called Worker Cooperatives in which precisely that is the case, and there are plenty of successful ones. An example would be the Mondragon corporation, a federation of worker cooperatives which forms the seventh largest business in Spain. While Mondragon still engages in many of the exploitative behaviour as other entities under capitalism, it stands as an example of how successful worker self-management can potentially be.

&gt;And not everyone can do every job. Ignoring educational requirements for certain jobs, it would be wildly inefficient. 

I'm not saying that everyone should do every job.

&gt;4. This can be done under capitalism, and is. I don't know how this impacts innovation though, because a lot of specific specialty tools won't be available no matter the economic system. 

Capitalism lacks the public funding to implement an idea like this on a relevant scale. Exceptions would be mixed economies and social forms of capitalism, with which I have my own issues.

And it would further innovation by simply getting more people involved and passionate in the process.

&gt;5. Maybe. I don't know if that's only because it's a much more fruitful endeavor. This can be done under capitalism anyway, as it is in many countries today. Socialism impedes entrepreneurship. I've never seen an argument that socialism helps entrepreneurs or the rate of entrepreneurship, just that it eliminates the risk.

A decentrally planned economy could encourage entrepreneurship by means of cooperation. I'll try to explain this in the context of our current world. Imagine you want to start your own venture. Currently that demands you to be familiar with every little aspect of the matter, or at least to be able to hire people who are. And even then there is still plenty of room for you to mess something up which isn't even related to the merit of your actual idea, such as marketing. Now imagine you could instead just ask for the support of a well-established business like Google and they would send you a guy to help you out a little, together with a bunch of instructional material. This time, the only variables which could lead to your failure are those which you actively chose to do differently, in other words those you actually care about and think you could do better.

But keep in mind, of course entrepreneurship would generally look very different in my preferred socialist system than it currently does. The only reason I mentioned it initially was that it serves as an example for how people appear to be far more willing to improve society when the risk they take isn't too great to bear.",PoliticalDebate,1619251846.0,Asato_of_Vinheim,,1,,mwz9wc,"Okay, first off: socialism isn't when the government does stuff.

https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/education/private-school-cost-vs-public-school/

2. The best way to do this is to encourage small business development in low income and poverty stricken areas. We need relaxed zoning laws, the end of the drug war, and start reallocation welfare funding to low or no interest business loans or even grants in these areas. Socialism won't solve that problem, as capitalism is what maximizes economic growth. 

3. I agree to a point. Definitely need a reform here, but I'm not sure if this really inhibits innovation though. 

4. This can be done under capitalism, and the best way to start is by teaching people all the things motivational speakers teach people that so many dismiss. First, when one is a worker, you are the product. You're selling your skills and time, make yourself worthwhile. The job interviewer is the buyer. Second, do something you love. 40 hours a week is not much at all, and there is plenty of time to do hobbies and other things if what you love doesn't make money. Third, be healthy. Eating correctly and exercising has a ton of benefits, including improved attitude. There was an experiment done where people working in a factory did vote on every decision made. I believe this was in South America.

gwjjqoh,gwlus85,"&gt;To clarify another point, marriage is not beneficial to children. Long term stable family support structures are.

I would argue this is (at least in part) the point of the institution.",PoliticalDebate,1619915987.0,AgainstModernity,,1,,n27qrj," ""Why don’t schools teach that marriage is good and important?""

First, marriage is not good or important. That is your values, and in general, public schools are not interested in imposing values. This was not always the case, but in general modern schools try to be as neutral as possible with ideals like patriotism, religion, and traditional values being less prominent. This is because schools exist for the education of everyone, so attempting to impose one cultural norm is automatically exclusionary and gets in the way of education.

To clarify another point, marriage is not beneficial to children. Long term stable family support structures are. Children of unmarried couples do not show worse outcomes, children of same sec couple do not show worse outcomes, and children raised by extended family or larger family units (for example single mother being supported by her parents) do not show worse outcomes. 

In short they do not teach values because it is not their job, and gets in the way of education which is their job. To address a common response: ""schools do impose values like cultural and religious acceptance."" Yes, they teach these things because schools have to have a culture of acceptance for hundreds of thousands of students to exist alongside each other. This is also why students teach to obey authority, because it is required for the operation of the school.",-xXColtonXx-,,3,,1619878814.0,[removed],hdudjegsikd,,7,1619830792.0

So hear me out. Both parties are guilty of this, but I’ve noticed more and more that the right wing is fueled by hate, false evidence, and stereotypes. I mean before, at least they would pull out half-true facts that could be cited from an at least reputable source. Today, with the media being more polarizing than ever combined with algorithms on your phone, it’s easy to get caught in a loop of the same political jargon that’s fed to you day in and day out. And eventually if you’re told it enough and you see it on the tv and radio enough, and every time you open your phone, you’ll eventually start to believe it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;THIS IS BRAINWASHING. Literally conditioning your brain to believe something that might only be half true or not true at all! I don’t understand why this isn’t talked about more by people, or why people don’t realize that all the media was meant to do was convince you that there is a problem that needs to be solved by their endorsed party’s method. Even if there isn’t really a problem at all. They find things to argue and debate about just because they know it’ll get you riled right up and willing to donate money or your vote to them so that they can gain control of where your tax money is.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;It’s all a big ploy. But the republicans AND their base are the ones who are unwilling to divide the wealth equally across the nation. This is because they perpetuate the false idea that anyone born in the USA has just as much opportunity as the next guy. This isn’t only false, but it’s a lie told to you by the wealthy &amp; the people they pay so that they get to keep their milked money from you, the person who paid for their yacht. The same can honestly be said for many many democrats as well. It’s just more greed from them though than that combined with prejudice and racism, which is worse.

Very good point. Noted.

&gt;Solvency. So you say if the society provides the first 4 levels of Maslow's Hierarchy, this will make people self actualized but you don't show how. We're just going to presume that if your basic needs are met you're going to judge situations correctly and honestly. Why would we believe that? Sounds like snake oil.

Not sure what you mean by Solvency here.

So the way Maslow's theory works is that people are driven by the lowest level of unmet desire. Think about a billionaire, someone who is totally self-actualized and can do pretty much whatever they want within the physical laws of the universe. Let's say that billionaire chooses to be an artist. If you are able to cut off that person's air supply, they are going to very quickly switch from working on being the best painter/artist they can be to focusing on getting that air supply. The same is true of the other needs that people need. It doesn't matter if it's food or water or social acceptance, at some point that person is going to switch their efforts from painting to getting whatever they need that's missing.

So if we're able to reorganize society to provide as many of the basic needs as possible, then individuals are able to focus on becoming the best version of themselves, as they see/imagine it. 

It's not so much about judging situations correctly as it is about having the freedom to live life like you want to.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Premise that ""self actualized"" people make the best citizens isn't supported. In fact, several of the characteristics listed in the Wiki ( not reliant on culture and environment to form opinions and views.) (True to oneself, rather than being how others want.) (Self-actualizers are free from reliance on external authorities or other people. They tend to be resourceful and independent) are tough sells for ""perfect citizens"". So you may want to work on forming that link.

  
Right, I think the critical point is that self-actualized people are able to think and act in accordance with their own morals and motivations. They do things because they want to, not because they have to. ""Perfect"" is probably the wrong word to use here, but I would argue that self-actualized citizens are better than the ""average"" citizen because they can think for themselves. Not that they aren't susceptible to propaganda and other forms of psychological influence, but they are more resistant to going along with the crowd's opinions just because of peer pressure because they have a robust self-esteem.",PoliticalDebate,1625696657.0,its-a-me-Marcos,,1,,ofq6o4,"Here are the flaws I see so far. 

1. Premise that ""self actualized"" people make the best citizens isn't supported. In fact, several of the characteristics listed in the Wiki ( not reliant on culture and environment to form opinions and views.) (True to oneself, rather than being how others want.) (Self-actualizers are free from reliance on external authorities or other people. They tend to be resourceful and independent) are tough sells for ""perfect citizens"". So you may want to work on forming that link. 
2. Justice and national defense may seem obvious to you, but do the work. You may find that what you view as a ""no brainer"" is a point of contention. 
3. Solvency. So you say if the society provides the first 4 levels of Maslow's Hierarchy, this will make people self actualized but you don't show how. We're just going to presume that if your basic needs are met you're going to  judge situations correctly and honestly. Why would we believe that? Sounds like snake oil. 
4. Your economic argument for UBI needs work and research. There are very strong cases against UBI and you can't just fund it from Social Security. You post a link that says **BILLION** and you used **TRILLION** which are not the same. So you'd need a better source of funding and better math.

Lets say 80% of the poorest, who decides that? Is the state checking every persons bank account and income, go into their homes to see if they do indeed have more then they say? Or do people apply for it, by handing over that information freely? If they report it themselves everyone will look piss poor on paper because everyone would want that money, so everyone will report they have nearly nothing. So now the state needs to be able to check for themselves what is actually true.

Lets say 80% of all the adults, that is 202 million people the state now has to look into, how many people does the state need to hire to do this? Would 50,000 people be enough lets do some math. That would be 4040 people every single person hired to do this would have to check up on, so if they hire 50,000 people they are severely understaffed, lets not be cruel, lets hire 500,000 people so now they only have 404 people to check up on, still understaffed but maybe doable. 

Their yearly income will be lets say 40,000, that is a lot of that money gone. Since they have so many people to check on it will be damned slow as well.",baronmad,,1,,1625735466.0,[deleted],[deleted],,6,1625686121.0

hcfcmyp,hch3euw,"So... yes, communists and fascists murdered each other... But I can't stress this enough. Do you know how Ted sounds like a brainwashed person who believes things that are simply some weird propaganda?

When you lump Trump supporters and Proud boys in the same category as Nazis, you sound like the right wingers who lump Bernie supporters and Biden supporters in the same category as Antifa and eco terrorists and tankies.

The problem with US politics is that people speak in extremes. Instead of saying ""You're slightly left of center"" they say ""you're a communist"". This radicalized jargon removes the motivation of people to engage on a personal level with the speaker. And when people double down ""You're not just a communist, you're a Stalinist!"", it further removes motivation to even listen to the person. This is what you're doing.

So if you just want to be ignored by anyone who disagrees with you, and get upvotes from the head nodders who aren't really thinking that hard about what you're saying, but upvoting it because feelings... then keep on keeping on.

But if you're interested in having a conversation with people who disagree with you, but still take you seriously, you should probably stay away from this kind of extremist jargon.

The proud boys started as a conservative defense force against Antifa voter intimidation. Since then they devolved into a fight club. Their members span the gambit in race and background. But what they're not, is a Neo Nazi group. And some Neo Nazis support Trump, but saying that everyone.. or even a majority of people who support Trump want a dictator (which, while a narcissist, still seems invested in democracy despite the rhetoric about Jan 6th) who controls the means of production (which he's still very much a capitalist) and is in favor of actually murdering his opponents (which, NGL, wouldn't terribly surprise me but so far there's no evidence of this).. saying this removes you from the realm of reasonable and puts you into the cult.

Cultists can't be reasoned with. They'll use all their brainpower to prove that up is down, left is right, white is black. They paint themselves as smart, fully aware, enlightened individuals with moral superiority and clear insight into the secret workings of the world. You cannot reason with them.

David Duke ran won his Louisiana state seat as a Republican, sells his Klan mailing list to Republicans, and told his Klan members to vote for Trump. Marjory Taylor Green spews conspiracy theories about Jewish space lasers and wants to start a caucus for Anglo Saxon Protestant values. The PoC that DO run Republican are commonly mocked as race traitors.

I agree that in general, a lot of black, Latino, Asian, and Jewish people have conservative values and mistrust the government, and would, in a perfect world, vote conservative.

hfr9y46,hfrg59k,"Yeah there's plenty of right leaning news outlets. r/conservative links plenty of them. Fox is certainly not the only source you should look at for right-leaning opinions. I totally agree though that this is critical to have a large network on that side as there's no doubt that the vast majority of the industry (especially tech and large corporations) are biased towards the left. It's unfortunate times are so polarizing, but it's critical for them to be heard and not cancelled otherwise we failed to live up to the core philosophy of a Democracy, or more importantly American fundementals.

I'd like to add to your second point that being ""unbiased"" is likely not ever going to be a true case in today's age of ""journalism"". I appreciate those that try to be, however the problem is they still use the pretty phrasing one side makes to describe specific things as if it's their own words too. They also often miss a lot of criticism from the other side. It's like they don't take enough time to research fully both sides.

A good recent example is the optics that is being set on the 3.5 trillion bill, which is described as the only way to solve the looming government shutdown- despite the fact that there *will* be more procedural bills that must pass this session even if that passes. That bill is not a procedural bill, it's additional pork and would be the largest in over a half century.

This is a good point. If you were to make ""FOX News"" into ""A conservative news source"" the OP might be correct. I think that's more of a semantic argument though. 

&gt;Second, many neutral news sources exist which can satisfy both sides of the US political news in addition to other news from around the world.

Also technically correct. One might argue that neutral sources don't have the same investment in spinning events in a conservative manner, so if you were only to consume liberally biased and neutral sources, you may still get some left bias.

So ...

It is true that if a young woman goes to a frat house, she should be able to drink as much as she wants, wear whatever she wants, flirt, etc, without fear that she will be raped.  That said, it is also imprudent, and along with freedom comes a certain amount of responsibility for the consequences of your own actions.  Yes, you might be free to flash a lot of money in a seedy bar and know that should not be molested as a result, but the reality of the world we live in is that these kinds of actions are dangerous, and if we engage in them we have to be willing to accept the consequences.

That's true of Rittenhouse.  Yes, he should have been able to open carry a rifle in the city of Kenosha, anywhere he wanted to, in the street, on sidewalks, on private property that he had permission to be on, etc.  He has a much right to be on a public street as anyone else, protesters do not have some kind of special hall pass that lets them say who can and cannot be on the streets.  But with that said, .. he does bear some responsibility for the consequences of exercising those freedoms.

I think that Rittenhouse is more accurately described as a counter-protester, and again, though he should be allowed to counter-protest with a rifle in his hand if he wants to, like a young woman drinking at a frat party, ... that person has to reflect on the reality of the situation that they are creating under those circumstances, and I think Rittenhouse bears some responsibility for what happened.  Not \_LEGAL\_ responsibility, ... and nobody should be victim blaming him anymore than they would if it was a young woman who had just been attacked by a potential rapist, ... but on some level he has to know that the events of that evening would not have happened if he had stayed home.

Though Rittenhouse cannot be blamed legally for what happened, I am not sure he doesn't bear some moral responsibility for what happened.  Something on par with the moral responsibility rioters have for creating the situation in the first place.  Both parties where there of their own accord in a situation that they all knew was potentially volatile, and nobody who was there can have a completely clean conscience.  All of that aside, Rittenhouse was legally right, that is technically true ... which is the best kind of true.",vanshadow_ban,,1,,1637629595.0,[removed],Ted928,,3,1637628703.0

Irrelevant and immaterial. Even if he was attacked by Republican patriots with no criminal past, he would still have had a right do defend his life.

100% wrong in every single way imaginable. For instance, putting yourself in a situation where you've incited violence and then using deadly force to defend yourself is illegal in many US states. You can't start a fight, then claim ""I was in fear of my life"" and kill someone.

Of course, they will also say that no one was trying to murder this guy, while at the same time claiming that he was obviously a threat to others. 

This argument against Kyle's claim of self defense is further fueled by the fact that he used an AR 15 which means that they can further claim that **OBVIOUSLY** he's guilty because he had a rifle and believes in the 2nd amendment. Anyone who believes in the 2nd amendment is a psychopath waiting for the first opportunity to murder someone.

hlpve0i,hltwuwy,"You did a very good job, and that you're right aristocrats don't want a civil war. However *they are* the ones that are fueling this.

It's crony capitalists that have secured their position of wealth and influence, that are the ones pitching this idea of socialism (because it sounds nice, who wouldn't want to not work to live?) However it ultimately will always hurt the middle class due to the way *they* designed the tax system. Taxes have ever only hurt the middle class and poor because of the way it was designed, by keeping those lower classes down making it harder to climb to their level. That's what they want, so that they stay in control and power.

Now it's without saying that both major parties have large crony capitalists, but it's really pathetic that the Democrat party outright ignores and denies the crony capitalism that are the driving forces of their party. As if Big Tech, Big Media, George Soros, Big Unions, and the likes don't all for the large part handle their financing and act as a hand in controlling political information.

The idea of socialized healthcare sounds great, and I personally think it's achievable, however it's not as simple as passing a bill adding it to our system. We need to change how the medical and pharmaceutical companies price, which is another industry that largely supports Democrats because they won't address the cost problem. Just add it to the budget, eh? 

Shut down small businesses because of a barely lethal virus, eh? Make it harder to start businesses by adding more red tape. Sexualize children by telling them they are a gender they aren't, fucking with their mental health and potentially physical development with HRT. Changing definitions of words to further a political goal.

Tell them they are racist because of the color of their skin in a context that had nothing to do with race, and that America is fundementally racist despite being the country that championed the free world. Bailing out criminals and dropping charges against actual murderers because of their race under the guise of a pandemic. Appearently equality under law isn't a thing anymore, it's now all about *equity*. When will they ever realize equity can't be achieved without discrimination, just like Affirmative Action?

All of these things are being done to make you feel mentally unstable, insecure, and exhausted, ultimately unwilling to tell them no.

&gt;what Democrats are known for now is trying to label and undermine America as a racist country so they can bring it down and turn it socialist.

The fact that you're saying these things is kind of proof in and of itself that Democrats, at least, can't be entirely at fault for the current divisions. For one, I think it's fair to say the founding fathers did not create this country so that people would feel compelled to idolize them or a piece of fabric to prove their loyalty to the ideals instilled in the Constitution. The fact that you refer to Democrats as ""socialists"" is even more telling. I'm not going to get into whether socialism is good or bad. I think that the idea has its flaws but it has been heavily demonized by people further right on the political spectrum. Regardless, many Republicans try to label every single Democrat as being a socialist, even though it's not remotely true for the vast majority, if any of them. Even Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, who refer to them themselves as ""Democratic socialists"" or ""social Democrats"" don't actually embody the values of socialism with what they argue for. Expansions of the social safety net is not the same as nationalizing all industry and removing private ownership of factories and farms.

The fact is, both sides have contributed to the current polarization. One could have a debate about to what extent each has contributed, but it takes two to tango.

Yet yes if you look at the party policies throughout history D has always been on the side that incites strong polarization due to their ride or die mentality. Especially true today.

It's really simple political mechanics. You find or create a class of people, such as whites, and you make an enemy out of them. It's really interesting though how D decided to go to the extreme polar opposite of their party messaging prior to the 70's which is that black man bad. Now it's white man bad. And they feel morally superior.

Rather than stop being racist, they found a different way to be racist through white guilt. Create an enemy, and justify justify justify.

I think the most dangerous aspect is certainly the god-complex there. Many 'villian' leaders in history that have lead to dangerous crimes against humanity such as Hitler had a god-complex and himself and others believed he had good intent for the German people. Austria and Czechoslovakia had millions of German people living there, that's why those governments submitted to Germany originally and which lead to their demise. Ultimately once he had power he carried out some pretty horrific stuff for the sake of German Empire superiority. The road to hell is paved with good intent. Democrats beleive they're morally superior by virtue signaling and helping minorities, because that is what the party leaders have made them believe. This is becoming very similar to Germans helping their own people and virtue signaling ""hail"". Once you get some people on the idea that they're morally superior, you can get many more because of the crowd affect and bullying tactics. Party leaders are followed like sheep, but the people are the ones responsible for instilling in each other collectivist propaganda. Comparitively Republicans, for the most part, are very individual thinking.

Democrats have openly called for a new Constitution because it doesn't work in their favor. Every other country like Canada and Germany and the UK do not have an enumerated right to free speech and religion, that is why they're suffering the consequences of that right now. We're just suffering because we have corrupt old people running the show that want to line their pockets before they leave (under the false sale of socialism.)

It's good, but so many people are against nuclear because of horror stories from decades ago. Most people wouldn't even know if a nuclear power plant is near them, that's how little they know about it. There's one 45 minutes away from the city I live in, and most people in this city have no idea. Usually when people find out, they have a negative reaction, and are happy it's being shut down now, even though it provided power with no issues for over 40 years. We would need a large campaign to promote nuclear to the public. The other options are just way too expensive right now. 

&gt;With respect to taxation, I have a lot more ideas like this.

Don't have more ideas like this. The taxation is absolutely ridiculous. 50% on assets? So if someone owns a business that is worth more than $5m, they need to pay 50% of that value in taxes? Wtf. Also, very few people earn $2m or more a year. You must be confusing net worth with income. We shouldn't punish people for increasing their net worth. If we do, people won't do it. Also, no business makes money ""at the tax payers expense."" That's not how businesses work. Besides, the top 1% already pay like 40% of the taxes, while the bottom 40% pay net zero taxes. 

Taxing people like that just to pay teachers is stupid as well. First off, no one wants to live in inner cities, they're all shitholes. Why don't we fix the cities first? Second, why does the teacher have to live in the same zip code? This would also lead to increased housing prices in places where space and housing is already extremely limited. The way to fix housing prices is to eliminate rent controls, and change our zoning laws.

&gt;BBB is and was a disaster. Adding 2 - 3% inflation to an already horrible Macro inflation environment

Can you provide more detail on this claim, why is it a disaster, simply because it caused inflation in your view? Is there any government spending which causes inflation that can do more good than harm in your view?

&gt;Green policies are a joke and put us on a similar path as the Europeans

Why do you consider the green policies a joke? Are the not doing enough or are they doing too much, why would being on the same path as the Europeans be a bad thing?

&gt;Border policy is essentially to gaslight and pretend it's not happening

Pretend what's not happening? What harm comes from not persecuting illegal immigrants?

&gt;Very pointless and divisive messaging regarding Vaccines and a ""With us or against us"" attitude

Why is it pointless to attempt to ensure that people are vaccinated versus a deadly and disruptive disease?

&gt;Building a horde of 87,000 IRS agents to release on the upper middle class

Can you provide a source on this? I think the IRS is dramatically underfunded due to Republicans starve the beast strategy and that means that the IRS does not have the resources to go after those that are the worst offenders, can your provide proof that they have increasingly gone after upper middle class people instead of the wealthy upper class people they should rightfully be targetting?

&gt;Left multi billions of dollars of military equipment in the hands of a group of people very likely to use it for very bad purposes

Sure that was a bit of a failing but do you think that the Taliban honestly has the training and capacity to utilize that equipment? Have you not seen the video of them trying and failing to fly a helicopter that was left behind? That machinery is no good without the supply, maintenance, and logistics that only America can provide.

- Green policies are a joke and put us on a similar path as the Europeans
- Border policy is essentially to gaslight and pretend it's not happening
- Very pointless and divisive messaging regarding Vaccines and a ""With us or against us"" attitude
- Building a horde of 87,000 IRS agents to release on the upper middle class
- Wrecking US energy output to please a class of people that will not feel the negative effects 
- Left multi billions of dollars of military equipment in the hands of a group of people very likely to use it for very bad purposes 

Trump Negatives:

- Generally a self serving egotistical child
- Probably low level and high functioning insane person
- Tax Bill passed was a big missed opportunity to actually simplify and rewrite tax code
- Stirred controversy when it was not needed
- Was horrible at hiring cabinet advisors
- Authorized the covid shutdown
- Jan 6 and election denial is really pretty awful and dumb

 Biden Positives:

- Not Trump
- Released gas reserves from the strategic reserves to cool prices (iffy on this one because it could cause worse future problems)
- Don't know. Probably more, but I really can't stand this guy right now

Trump Positives:

- Brought issues like immigration and globalization to the forefront when they had been ignored for too long.
- Never tried to pass any groundbreaking nation changing legislation (This is a positive for me since I think most efforts like this cause more harm than good)
- Actually legitimately funny
- Kept the US out of more wars and verbally stood up against the war machine more than any other president I have witnessed 
- Fought against teachers unions to open schools during covid


Ultimately Trump was better because he didn't pass damaging legislation, he changed the political hot button issues to things most everyday Americans actually care about, and kept the US out of foreign entanglements. He thought outside the box which was and is badly needed with such a bizarre and out of touch group of politicians we have. He loses a lot of points for being such a self absorbed jackass though. He was and is a terrible symbol and ""face"" of the country.

Russia knows it can't win anything, which is why I think Putin's aim has never been to win any war but just to make money somehow or to have more fun, since life can get boring if you don't start a war somewhere. Western governments, arms makers and related companies make money too. I think this whole thing was just so some people could make an extra buck. And don't forget that Ukrainians were hostile against ethnic Russians beforehand (banning the use of the Russian language), so I think much of this hate was manufactured before the invasion, similar to the Hutu vs Tutsi thing.

We tried to convince the population to resist the taliban, when in reality all they wanted was for the fighting to stop at almost any price. So that’s why as soon as we left, they just gave up.

The Ukrainians were fighting back INCREDIBLY ferociously even before western support started arriving in large portions. And ever since then, they’ve proven again and again that they’re willing to to do whatever it takes, including sacrificing their lives, in order to take back their homeland from a dictator. So whatever we send will be put to good use. 

And when it comes to resources: it’s true that Russia could, if it wanted to, wage war for a very long time. But you should take the time to look at some figures like military balance, gross domestic product, etc. If you do, you’ll see that the USA outmatches Russia in almost every field by a wide margin, and that’s even BEFORE we count all of America’s allies. All together, the west has enough military and economic power to sustain a war of attrition for as long as it takes for Ukraine to win. Not only that, but they can do so without actually sacrificing much of their standard of living.

So in other words: the west and Ukraine have the two most important factors in a war like this one: the west has more resources than russia, and Ukraine has more willpower than russia.

jaqy0ei,jartmuz,"&gt;There is a lean toward cutting taxes by the Republicans and a lean toward increasing taxes by the Democrats. 

That's true only for the highest income earners. For middle and lower income workers, republicans want to raise taxes while democrats want to cut them.

&gt;That means that Republicans' tax reform law resulted in the tax code becoming slightly more progressive - the exact opposite of what Democrats have claimed over the past four years.

What that really means is the wealth divide has continued to grow so badly that even the regressive tax policies of republicans result in the wealthiest paying more because they have captured nearly all financial wealth. 

What it has meant to the lower brackets is they have a lower share of the income so pay lower taxes but pay increased fees and costs for services like healthcare.

&gt;IRS data shows earners in higher income brackets contributed a bigger slice of the total income tax revenue pie following the passage of the tax reform law than they had in the previous year.  
  
In fact, every income bracket with filers earning $200,000 or more increased its tax burden in 2018 compared to 2017, and every income bracket with a top limit lower than $200,000 paid a smaller proportion of the total personal tax revenue collected.

2A. Republicans don’t want everyone to wield guns with no repercussions. They want those who will be responsible with them to have equal access. I would argue that the “actual solution” you suggest most Republicans would be fine with.

You're just saying you should account for spending when increasing revenue. That's just what all good governments should do, and democrats generally achieve whenever they're in power. 

IMO, the best way to do it is to just raise taxes on the wealthy, since none of them earned that wealth anyway. there isn't really any CEO in the US who works hundreds of times harder than his lowest employees.

I would suggest Elon Musk is probably the least hard worker in Tesla. billionaires are a negative on society and don't provide any benefit

k6gb2b3,k6j804k,"That's interesting, because it's actually a similar arguement that is used by ancaps. That the problems of ancap will be alleviated by future solutions produced by an ancap society.

Now I know Marx coined the term capitalist, so I can't really argue in a water tight manner that Jeff bezos is not a capitalist, but he's certainly not a free-marketeer (because as you say he believes in economic central planning) and that's certainly what ancaps mean when they use the term capitalist (even if it's use may be incorrect).

In the video I linked it is asserted that supersedence of the market method of calculation of resource allocation is entirely conceptually infeasible. To use your analogy it's more like saying that there will never be a horseless horse. Without trade value itself cannot be established. It's a bit like in a toxic relationship how you have no idea how the other person is truly feeling because you cannot directly trade emotions. You have to use some proxy to convey the emotions which thereby accurately represents your position as an individual. So take out the market and the trade and the question becomes how can you make evaluations without value. I can conceptualise how such a circumstance might be feasible if one is to have some way of mind reading each individual and gauging their states in real time then comparing them to others with some huge super computer.

Communism/socialism involves the end of exploitation, rentierism, and the end of class distinctions and therefore class antagonisms. Any new superior mechanisms for allocating scarce resources, that supersede markets, will only arise after we eliminate capitalism.

IQ doesn't tell you anything useful aside from if you are developmentally disabled and cannot do basic tasks, which is what the army uses it for. 

What matters for jobs is can you do the job. Not how fast can you spin this 3D shape around in your head.

Anyway, it seems like what you're trying to say is that Affirmative Action is anti-meritocratic and thus holds companies back. They could be hiring a smart White Guy but they have to hire a woman or a Black person.

So one, this is based on a misunderstanding of Affirmative Action (AA). AA does not mean you can hire based on race. Correct me if I'm wrong but it is illegal to base your hiring decisions on race or gender. What companies focus on, instead is outreach. That is what AA essentially is. There are programs they work with (like ""Inroads"" in New England) which place minorities in job interviews. They hold job fairs in minority schools and neighborhoods. Things like that. 

Programs like Inroads have a very high threshold. Students have to have a GPA of 3.2. So they don't even help you write a resume or give interview tips unless you are a really good student already on your way to success. (Which I think is problematic as well).

The other thing is that you're assuming without AA our companies are beacons of meritocracy. In reality, if you have ever worked a job you know nepotism, connections and all that are extremely important. The so-called AA hire is most likely a 4.0 GPA student who replaced a white kid who only would've got the job because his dad works there. If anything, this forces companies to look away from the existing incestuous pool of talent and look outside.

There is also undeniable implicit and explicit racial bias that puts Black people at a disadvantage. There was a study that showed Black sounding names on resumes were ignored. Plenty of studies showing subconscious bias even within well-meaning folks. 

If a sport or a workplace is \*all\* white, then you have to wonder why there are no Black people represented. You're assuming it's because Black people have lower IQs and they are just better at basketball than Excel. But IQ is actually bullshit and usually the reason you don't have any Black employees is because of racism. AA is (or was) an attempt to account for this. Employers are overlooking competent Black employees for jobs and for promotions because of racism. AA helps them correct that. 

To sum it up: No, our workplaces are not meritocratic, and, no, Affirmative Action does not reduce meritocracy, but probably improves it.",marxianthings,1.0,1,0.0,1698420186.0,[removed],Delicious-Agency-824,1.0,1,1698383856.0

The reason some corps. get in hot water with the EEOC, other governing bodies and discrimatory lawsuits generally comes down to outright bias in the hiring pratice. Generally these firms have a document bias (for example) that only men are capable programers.   

*Yet USA company cannot hire people based on IQ.*

This is nonsense. Low IQ people are not a protected class thus would have no case for discrimination. A majority of companies have a variety of preemployment screeners and tests which they use to weed out applicants. So long as the tests are legitimate (not some quackery) and are tied to the job discription (IQ test for a Fast food job makes no sense) the employer is free to discriminate baised on the outcome of the test.

I can think of half a dozen former POTUS who said equally inflammatory and ignorant thoughts. Remember the 1994 Crime Bill? Bush 41 opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Here's a great [racist conversation](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/ronald-reagans-racist-conversation-richard-nixon/595102/) shared by Nixon and Reagan. Can we call something ""extreme"" if it's actually fairly common?

>embracing autocrats

This is [Obama literally physically bowing](https://images.app.goo.gl/njkgYMXHCp67yq8W6) to the Saudi King. People forget [Jimmy Carter was a good to despots](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19940926&slug=1932656). In this regard, did Trump deviate from standard precedent?

>ostracizing allies

Most famously, Bush 43 basically [bullied](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jun-22-fg-bush22-story.html) everyone he could into joining his Global War on Terror. Snowden's leaks showed the world [Obama was spying on world leaders](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/10/29/241576536/report-obama-white-house-okd-spying-on-other-leaders) -- Europeans were pissed about that. 

>Massive deficits.

If you don't know, GWOT costs tens of trillions ([Brown U says USD$8T and 900K dead](https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-01/costsofwar#:~:text=PROVIDENCE%2C%20R.I.%20%5BBrown%20University%5D,War%20project%20at%20Brown%20University.)) and Obama added [USD$8.6T](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/us-debt-by-president-by-dollar-and-percent-3306296) to the deficit during his 8 years. Again, although to any reasonable person these are extreme amounts of money, to POTUS it's pretty standard given historical precedent.

>not listening to experts ... lies ... sedition.

Alarmingly common in US politics, actually. Truman [fired](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_of_Douglas_MacArthur) his expert on war during a war. Tricky Dick Nixon [pulled a Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/10/the-time-nixons-cronies-tried-to-overturn-a-presidential-election-428318) on Kennedy -- or did Trump pull a Nixon?

I identify Trump as an extremist for how he behaves, what he believes in, and how he guides the MAGA movement.

I invite people to read Fein's *Invisible Hands* and MacLean's *Democracy in Chains* to see how this movement developed *without* Trump. Trump came along and took it over and became it's champion. But it wasn't inherently his, either.

So why do I see Trump as not a centrist? In many ways I don't think the center exists the way others do probably. His base is around 30% of the American population, themselves fairly far right. In general:

* An embracing/admiration of and for dictators like Putin, Xi, Duterte, Kim, and others.
* Trump's insistence on violence with the political sphere. ""Hit him, get him out of here and don't be gentle either.""

And to those who say that its not who say otherwise what else could it be???

That covers nature and nurture, so what else could shape a person. 

What you are proposing does fall roughly in eugenics and social Darwinism which isn't a bad thing, I think intervention from institutions for curation of the gene pool is a terrible decision but in the same way that allowing people with diseases to have children that are destined to suffer or live short lives is also immoral. There is no way to control such populations without institutional intervention so allowing people to die is the correct answer.

**BUT**

That decision is no longer necessary. With the dawn of designer babies in the future we can replace morally odd with the morally decrepit by allowing the wealthy to curate the genetics of their offspring essentially making a caste system where you have a ruling class and the labor and once the labor is automated you will be left with a sliver of humanity. Since the first solution is something that requires action it is not likely, but designer babies will be at the will of market forces meaning it will likely make 3rd or even 1st world countries that don't adapt quickly enough at a significant disadvantage. Those who can ensure the smartest versions of their offspring will likely see generational wealth become dynastic as long as the use of designer baby tech is relegated to moderate intelligence. For those who crack the code on intelligence in general may accidentally extinguish the medium to high intelligence population by making people who will refuse to procreate.

It is kind of a fools errand to contemplate to be honest, as long as those who have less innate intelligence out reproduce intelligent people humanity will inevitably be evolving toward horny over any other independent factor.

No matter how you dice things humanity is only selecting for those who tend to think life is okay enough to live and to ignore the moral rammifications of creating another being that can suffer into the world.

If Marxist ideology is summed up by the Communist Manifesto, then by all means please edit the title of the post to reflect that it is a criticism of Marxism.  

At least as far as I understood it from a plain text reading (barring any ""reading between the lines"" type undertones I'm unaware of), the Communist Manifesto tracks perfectly with what I'd understood of it from my admittedly very limited previous knowledge, with the only new concept I was made aware of in actually reading it being the idea of a ""petty bourgeois"" class.  

The central premise of communism, which is the idea that capitalism is inherently evil and exploitive and that the only means to overcome this evil is to steal from (and if necessary, kill) the capitalist so his property can be redistributed to society as a whole, can be summed up as precisely that.  I don't find it necessary to do a deep dive into things like mandated centralized banking or the theft of property belonging to those choosing to flee communism, in order to discuss that central premise.

If you're going to start by saying ""let's be honest"" your first point of evidence ought to be honest. For starters, being armed does not require there to be a gun. You can be armed with a knife, a bat, a machete. A flag pole can be an arm. But just to be clear here 

https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/30-months-jan-6-attack-capitol

110 people were charged with assault with a deadly weapon here. These were not all unarmed protestors. So reframe the basis. They were armed and 110 people used those arms to cause severe bodily harm

>Just a few weeks ago, a protest breached a congressional building

Yes this protest. Which had 0 injuries, 0 assaults and the capital guards were surrounding the protestors to protect them. See here's a fun fact, it is 100% legal to protest on the capitol grounds and in the capital *as long as it doesn't result in an interruption to congress* that's the law. You can go there and have a sign. They didn't breach security, they didn't catch 110 assault with a deadly weapon charges. They simply walked in, and sat down.  That is a ""peaceful and patriotic protest"" 

>Just a few weeks ago Rep Jamaal Bowman (D) pleaded guilty on Thursday after being charged with falsely pulling the fire alarm at a congressional office building as a means of delaying a vote.

Which is terrible, and resulted in 0 injuries and the penalty for doing this is a fine. He is in congress, the ""interrupting congress"" clause is very limited for congress members, any time a member goes over time and delays congress they would go to jail. And the penalty for pulling a fire alarm is a fine usually so sure hit him with it. Ya know what. Give him the max sentence and let him sit 30 days in jail. Would that make you happy.

This is the problem with the 1/6 denials. You draw 100 false equivalents and wonder why the only people you can convince are the ones who agreed with you to start with. In a post about honesty in discussion your first actual evidence was a lie and you want anyone to take anything else seriously?

>Both sides of this issue talk past each other because it seems like the left is okay when the political violence is on their side, but they demand the right atone for the sins of a group of people on the right doing something wrong-- illegal-- but decidedly less violent.

No, we talk past the issue for precisely the opposite reason. Because the right can go into the capital and try to stop an election catch 110 assault charges, cause cops to kill themselves cause millions of dollars of damages, steal podiums and threaten to kill people and that's just ""a minor event"" but when the left protests a genocide in Palestine sitting on the floor hurting nobody the right says ""look violence, criminals! Arrest them all"" it's a joke. The statistics and analysts weigh against you


https://ccjs.umd.edu/feature/umd-led-study-shows-disparities-violence-among-extremist-groups

>""the researchers zeroed in on acts of extremism in the United States from 1948-2018. They found nearly no difference between the likelihood of an Islamist extremist and a right-wing extremist committing an act of violence; the probability of a violent act of extremism in the United States being committed by a left-wing extremist was found to be 0.33, 0.61 by a right-wing extremist, and 0.62 by an Islamist extremist."" 

Because since 1984 the likelihood of a right wingers conducting a terror attack is .01% less likely than an Islamic extremist where left wing extremism is .29% less likely 

The difference comes not from the lefts denialism, it comes entirely from the rights denialism and the closed media network on the right flat out lying to you on tbe facts as I have already demonstrated by your ""unarmed"" statement. If you don't even have the basics of the event right because you're so lied to and closed off to reality, how the heck are you going to propose anybody else ignores anything.

k8k1v7i,k8k27y5,George Floyd OD'd on fentanyl. He wasn't worth a single protest.,PoliticalDebate,1699564775.0,meandthemissus,-1.0,-1,0.0,17rii04,"As a leftist, my take is a bit different:

I don’t care about the damage that was caused by the George Floyd protests or Jan 6th. I don’t care whether either of those groups were armed or not, nor do I care about whatever property damage they caused. I care much more about why they did it. 

The reason I support the George Floyd protests but not Jan 6th is because one of them was morally justified and the other was not. In the decade leading up to the GF protests, countless black people were mistreated by the police. Whether it was racial profiling, getting beaten up, getting higher sentences for the same crimes as their white counterparts or being killed in broad daylight, black people were routinely treated violently by cops. This led to nearly a decade of peaceful protests and calls for taking away police funding and using it for something better. The demand was clear, if you’re not going to do your job right, you don’t deserve to continue getting billions of dollars every year. These protests were largely ignored. 

Fast forward to 2020, and a man gets killed out in the open, in the middle of the day. Dozens of people watched, 4 cops were there and any of them could’ve stopped the murder, the whole thing was filmed, and yet he died. No trial, no hearing, no judge or jury to give an accurate punishment, just an execution, because one guy decided he had the power to do it. For the people who had been watching the last 10 years of police violence and getting constantly ignored, it was a breaking point. So obviously people were angry, what else do you expect? I don’t care that cars were set on fire, I don’t care that stores were broken into, I don’t care about any of that stuff. The blame 100% falls on the US government for not actually solving the problem, even though people asked nicely over and over again. I don’t blame the protesters for the most part. 

Now, let’s apply this framing to the Jan 6th protests. What were they demanding? What made these people upset enough to break into the capitol building? Well, it was because their candidate didn’t get elected, and the other party’s candidate did. That’s it. If you listen to the Jan 6th protesters, that was the big grievance. Not that they couldn’t feed their kids, not that they were being beaten by cops on a regular basis, not that their lives were at risk, but that the guy they liked couldn’t be in charge anymore. These people flew in on a Tuesday afternoon. They were not poor, struggling 9-5 workers who just felt unheard by their leaders. These people were doing fine for the most part, but felt entitled that they should always get their way no matter what. They should always have their preferred candidate no matter what the votes say. “It’s my country, this country was built for me, it should be my candidate. Me, me, me. Always me.”

That is why so many people support the George Floyd protests but not Jan 6th. It has nothing to do with the outcome or the damage that was caused. It has nothing to do with “the threat to democracy.” It has everything to do with why they did it. It has everything to do with the fact that hundred of thousands of people were conned into thinking they won when they really lost. And they simply couldn’t handle it. “Me not getting my way for once? My candidate being unpopular? Impossible. Someone must’ve cheated. It’s the only way we could ever lose.”",NotAnurag,3.0,3,0.0,1699564647.0,[removed],meandthemissus,1.0,1,1699551759.0

Given that, if you were to increase a population size by over 100% so that the % of people living in the nation who were born there is below 50%, and you were to random sample it, you'd get a very high % not caring for democracy or wanting a theocracy.

What made covid seem more deadly is that we didn't have vaccines or heard immunity like we do with the flu. Plus, the original strand of covid had upwards of like a 2 week incubation period before symptoms could show. Meaning it could spread far and wide before its presence was even known, which meant people who were more susceptible to health problems would suffer more from it. Thus, masks and social distancing as a means of curbing the spread. 

Social distancing and masking were never meant to stop the spread. Just slow it down.

A decision not to take safety measures isn't a denial of science. Science doesn't tell you what to do or what risks are worth taking. I understand the risk of Covid, and I still don't think it's worth wearing a mask. I don't think it would be worth getting the vaccine even if it was 100% safe and 100% preventative of infection, which we know it's not. I'm allowed to make suboptimal decisions, for the same reason that I'm allowed to decide to go skydiving. The inherent health risk in that activity doesn't make me a gravity denier, it's just that I've decided that my personal enjoyment of life is worth the risk. 

What bothers me is when people focus on one thing as if it's the only problem in the world, and decide to aggressively mitigate that one thing without regard to how it affects anything else important or whether their mitigation is even helping. Shutting down the economy for a virus that doesn't even pose significant risk to regular people under 70 was always a smooth brain idea. Especially when we couldn't even keep Covid out of specific restricted access buildings like nursing homes despite mask and vaccine requirements. We were never going to keep it out of gen pop, all we were doing was breaking other things while chasing an impossible objective. 

And then you come on here and act like the people who disagree with you and turned out to have been right all along are somehow eliminating themselves from the gene pool through heritable stupidity.

kcco75x,kcd9pqy,LOL I think you misunderstand the concept of applying costs to the participant VS how the participant funds the payment of those costs.  Many states will allow you to post a cash bond in lieu of purchasing auto liability insurance but the participant (car owner) still ends up paying and not the taxpayer.  Forcing the taxpayer to pay for the costs incurred by the individual is usually called socialism.,PoliticalDebate,1701959297.0,JanFromEarth,1.0,1,0.0,18clvfu,"I think you misunderstand the concept of risk pooling that underpins insurance and how it relates to what you seem to want to do.  

For example you say that someone should be allowed to not wear a seatbelt if they don’t want to as long as you don’t pay for their costs when they get into an accident.  

But if you really want an insurance market that pools their risk, then they have to blend it with low risk drivers who do wear seatbelts and so you are not really eliminating paying for them to take the risk, because your premiums are higher than if they were not in the risk pool.  Actuaries facilitate risk pooling to enable competitive premiums that still allow the insurance company to stay solvent.  

It sounds like what you actually want is to keep people out of risk pools who engage in behaviors you don’t like or that you want to dictate that insurers can only pool risks that you approve of.  

You are also ignoring the other side of the equation, where the damage caused by someone without insurance may never be recovered if they simply don’t have assets to pay whereas risk pooling can enable payment even if the single person responsible doesn’t have assets to cover the damage.

If we, for example, replace safety measures against gun violence with gun owner insurance, then we'll have created a society where mass shootings are seen as an unavoidable but tolerable occurrence in the same way that getting your car dented by someone with car insurance is an unavoidable but tolerable occurrence. Even when the risk is to the actor alone, the toleration of their action by the government convinces others that such actions are acceptable. The fact of the matter is that we live in a society together, and if someone is allowed to do something considered bad enough to otherwise be prohibited, even by paying, it legitimizes their action and makes the consequences of their action acceptable.

In reality these events aren't just monetary costs. What is the dollar value of a life lost to gun violence? Most people would say that you really cant put a dollar value on that. The other issue is that individual actions have group consequences. Take seatbelts for example. An individual not wearing a seatbelt in the back seat can crush a front seat occupant.

Americans like to talk about how they need their guns to fight government tyranny.

These people have even showed up to antigovernmental protests in the past with guns to scare the protestors and there was once instance of one of them actually shooting several protestors.

While the idea of having guns to stop government tyranny sounds nice, the US has a weird culture where those who have all the guns are also the running dogs for the government and defend its tyrannical rule the most.

And there is really no reason for them to bother to attempt it, either. It’s not like it’s government critics who have all the guns. If that were the case, then the US government would probably be very quick to disarm its population. The people who have all the guns are the biggest supporters of government tyranny and actively oppose any sort of opposition.

Does a getaway driver worry about breaking the speed limit?",PoliticalDebate,1702090363.0,n_55,-1.0,-1,0.0,18e1qb7,"On your constitutional claim, you’re oversimplifying:

Yes, the text says the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. First, the text of the second amendment ties the right (and responsibility) to keep and bear arms to membership in a well regulated state militia. The purpose of this amendment was to ensure we’d be prepared to repel (British) invasion. In 2008, the Supreme Court for the first time read out the “well regulated militia” clause and determined that the 2nd Amendment granted on each individual a personal right to bear arms. Even then, Justice Scalia wrote that this right, like all rights, could be limited, “shall not be infringed” language notwithstanding. Here’s a test for yourself: do you believe you should be able to bring guns onto a commercial airplane? If not, you believe the right can be infringed. The first amendment also says congress “shall pass no law” abridging the freedom of speech. Likewise, congress is permitted to pass *some* laws abridging that freedom. A fact of a civilized society is that none of our freedoms are absolute. Not to mention, the framers could not have conceived of the power firearms would have today.


As for your second claim, that gun restrictions do nothing but affect normal people, it’s unclear what you mean. If a person must successfully complete a background check, for instance, before purchasing a firearm, sure that affects normal people. It also affects people with criminal histories. Further restrictions, like extended waiting periods, restrictions on high capacity magazines, mental health examinations for semi-automatic firearms, etc., would also certainly “affect” dangerous people. The idea they would “do nothing” but affect normal people is farcical.

The trope about criminals not obeying gun laws ignores that most people who snap and commit mass shootings don’t break a law until they start firing. They aren’t gang members or mobsters. They are mentally unstable people with easy access to AR-15s. Restricting that access absolutely would stop them.


Firearms should be restricted because (1) they are killing thousands of innocent Americans, including children in classrooms, every year (2) no one needs to have high powered guns for any reason, and (3) we have no absolute right to possess them.

This in no ways means that the Right do not believe in God, that's not the matter, its the matter of how religion has been and is used for political gain and promoted through culture wars under a political banner.    We see it vividly with the religious extremist Mike Johnson, from Louisiana (from the core in the [Bible Belt](https://whatstates.com/bible-belt/) *Religious Right Conservatives*) sitting in the seat as the Speaker of the House.   The same area which comprised the Confederacy and states that are sympathizers with Confederate Ideology.  This is *a big part of* the Religious Right. 

Over decades many fled to other more Upper Midwestern States and regions of the Northern Midwest and Northern west, seeking refuge from the changes that the Civil Rights Act of  1964 put in place. 

So, its is likely that the Post will receive many downvote from those sectors.    

Yet, let the discussion continue.

Ignorance exist, and over generation people learn, its not like everyone will learn on the same time frame, but learning creates change. 

Racial Ignorance has been pervasive in America for a very long time, each generation we move forward in more and more people coming to terms with the ignorance, of racism.  that process won't stop, as generation to come will continue to accept that racism is an ignorance they want no part of. 

We don't have a magic wand to wave over society, what we have is a society that learns and grows... and learning and growth takes time.   It take facing truths, as well facing ones self in the face of truths. 

We today, don't have the level of racism we had at the beginning of the 1960's, or the 1860's .... We are in the 21st Century.     We are not in the Era of such insidiousness of white people not allowing blacks to be on professional sports teams, we are no longer in the 1950's and early 1960's where white people denigrated black music.    We no longer have all white people in TV shows and movies.   

We have many things which repeatedly dispel the delusion of white supremacy, but yet, people still embrace the ignorance of white supremacy illusions. 

As one commenter said, many of these people come from poor backgrounds or from background that have some variation of  lower, to mid to upper class living, who simply can't digest that they don't get the unquestioned white privilege to have first opportunity, first choice, and first selection in everything, nor do they get to only toss out what they feel is the scraps and tell people to be happy with the scraps.    They don't get to move into position solely on skin color based nepotistic concepts of entitlement.  They've been angry about that for decades.

>  Its not clear what you mean when you say they try to overturn the results.

I thought it was quite clear, my bad. In this theoretical, Trump is elected in 2024 (that's stated so we know that). So overturning the results (the result being Trump was elected in 2024 which we already covered in the first point), just like was attempted in 2020 (Trump tried to overturn the 2020 result), would mean upending the election of Trump and trying to put Biden in. Do you want me to specifically list Biden? It is possible another Democrat will end up on the Democrat ticket (low probability but it is still such a high possibility compared to any other election) before November 2024 so I could see why me not listing Biden as the loser in 2024, in the hypothetical, would be confusing. 

&#x200B;

> The sitting president has a lot of actual power compared to ""Democrats"". 

If your point is that Biden will have a lot of actual power compared to Republicans, I don't understand your point since we saw what happened in 2020 and all that power Trump had didn't matter. Unless you want the question to setup a different scenario where the Democrats do a full takeover in 2024? Then that's a different topic entirely.

Pew's number show that there were quite a few Democrats who oppose and approve  removing Trump from the ballots. There were a significant number of Republicans, too, who approved the removal but obviously, the majority is ""flip flopped"" for both parties. Therefore, this is ripe for debate with good reasoning both sides. And I've read those arguments in light sprinkles in the comments. Why not give this group something to discuss about future elections to see how far we want or do not want this Colorado decision to go?

> I don't know what kind of answers you expect here. Its definitely a valid concern to worry about setting precedence, but it would be better to give past examples that have already happened rather than imagine ambiguous ones and ask people to debate them. 

I listed out the exact things that were present in previous presidential elections to make this as fair possible. Because if I don't, then it's not a fair comparison and then it's like saying, ""The Democrats were just a little mad. They did a few huffs and tuts. Should that get them kicked off the 2026 ballots?"" That's not good enough. There needs to be a close parallel to make a fair comparison.

If you want the question less loaded with the 4 elements, I can simply state, ""And the same variables are in place that existed in 2020"" and then list a bunch of citations? But that doesn't feel fair at all and is way too wide open for interpretation.  And people will just assume along party line talking points.

Sharia is one of the many reasons why Islam is more problematic than most other faiths. Mohammed was a prophet, but he also had to *govern*. This means that Islam is not only a guide to personal spirituality, but it also is a template for how to run a society.

Islam used to be a relatively positive influence on society back in the Middle Ages. Moderate Muslim regimes kept the light of civilization and progress burning as the Christian world descended into the Dark Ages of strict religious observance.

At some point, that dynamic flipped, and the west embraced a more secular, enlightened approach, while Wahabi Islam became more influential and began to hamper social and scientific progress in most Muslim countries.",Heap_Good_Firewater,4.0,4,0.0,1703781256.0,[removed],turnerpike20,1.0,1,1703740696.0

The signers dropped this long-standing precondition as they re-established diplomatic relations and deepened [security](https://www.asianews.it/news-en/Abraham-Accords-feed-Israeli-arms-sales-to-the-Arab-world-58591.html)  and economic cooperation with Israel, while Trump lavished them with  rewards, like an arms deal for the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and U.S.  recognition of the annexation of West Sahara for Morocco. It effectively  supplanted the Saudi government’s [Arab Peace Initiative](https://www.mei.edu/publications/arab-peace-initiative-returns-will-it-supplant-abraham-accords),  which since its 2002 introduction had been the foundation of the Arab  world’s program for resolving the conflict, placing the Palestinians  front and center.

The new normalization agreements’  foundational and cynical assumption was that the plight of the  Palestinians could and would be safely ignored and forgotten about by  both the region’s governments and the broader international community.  Both the [Trump administration](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-threatens-to-shutter-palestinians-d-c-office/) and, reportedly, [bin Salman](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/14/palestinians-reject-reports-of-saudi-pressure-on-abbas/),  pressured Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to assent,  while the states that signed continued paying lip service to the  Palestinian cause, claiming this normalization push would halt Israel’s  annexation plans for its illegal West Bank settlements.""

Of course not.   The idea is that a pipeline from SA to Europe would go through Israel. It was already agreed to in theory.    Iran couldn't have that being official. 

If you know about what was going on in the Middle East, trade between those countries were already happening, maybe not officially but happening.  Trump didn't get them to start talking, just put on paper what was already happening.  I won't argue that is a step forward, but this would have happened under Trump too.",chinmakes5,5.0,5,0.0,1704041143.0,[removed],pinner52,1.0,1,1704029379.0

Of the three things he mentioned border security, Saudi Arabia peace accords, and long term treasury bonds the presidential administrations control two of those three things. 

The thing is Trump was right about Saudi Arabia and he was politically right about the border. 

What’s notable about the Biden administration is that those policies were continued. The Biden administration has actively and aggressivly perused the alliance between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 

That alliance fell under because of a terrorist attack or a strategic attack by Iran under the guise of a terrorist attack. At this point in order for the alliance to succeed the Saudi’s are demanding the settlements end and the West Bank given back. 

Trumps pro Israel republicans would not be able to achieve this anyway. The onus is now entirely on Israel to vote in a liberal to achieve those ends. 

The Biden administration as a whole has also been pro border security overall to the chagrin of progressives. It’s one of the things they complain about him. 

Here is one of the first links 

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/03/01/politics/joe-biden-immigration-asylum/index.html

Chamath is basically complaining about optics here while also falling into the trap of optics. 

He is saying we hate Trump but he was right about these two issues. However he is now complaining about Biden because Biden isn’t loud about continuing these policies that Trump started because he doesn’t realize they are being continued. 

This is why policy wonkary matters. You actually have to see what administrations do not what they say and for both of these issues both administrations are in agreement.

On a side not this is also why you don’t complain about interest rates to the president. Jerome Powell couldn’t give two shits what the president says his entire role is to be politically separated and untouchable. 

TLDR: Chamath is dumb because he doesn’t read policy.",AnachronisticPenguin,6.0,6,0.0,1704045893.0,[removed],pinner52,1.0,1,1704029379.0
kfr6b0s,kfr6k55,How do you think Biden has handled the recent Israel/Palestine conflict?,PoliticalDebate,1704059612.0,pinner52,1.0,1,0.0,18v7sh1,"Trump, in hindsight, accurately observed that Germany was too reliant on Russian gas but never said anything about that over reliance prior to the invasion of Ukraine. Germany should not have decommissioned their nuclear power plants, as it is the least carbon emissions out of the largest scale generators and would have curtail reliance on fossil fuels such as natural gas.
 
With regards to the Middle East, Obama was tamping down stressors for the region with Iran Nuclear Weapons deal, which was not welcomed by Israel but the US is not obligated to make Israeli wishes come true but rather preemptively squash international tensions before shooting wars occur. Trump's foreign policy was too sycophantic to Israel's wishes which caused Arabs to view the US as beholden to Israel (US WAS no longer a good faith actor with a thumb on the scale in israel's favor but just a lap dog to israel). The big accomplishments of Trump in the Middle East was normalizing diplomatic relations with Israel and a handful of Sunni Muslim majority countries, with the demarcation that Isreal was allying with the Sunni powers and Iran was going to be on the other side with Shias and marginalized Sunnis (Islamic Brotherhood in Egypt deposed in military coup, Syrians opposed to al Assad's regime which would include the Kurds in Iraq, Turkey, and Syria). Trump moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which can't be rescinded without a major reversal of the US' relationship with Israel. 
  
Biden was given a far more screwed up diplomatic circumstances than Trump was given in 2017, so it's hard to point where Trump improved foreign policy.",SeanFromQueens,2.0,2,0.0,1704059514.0,[removed],pinner52,1.0,1,1704029379.0
