       "Capitalism is bad. Get over it. We gotta fight it. Don't hit me with that human nature look, or any of those you're stupid and unrealistic things. We're all just trying to live while we enrich someone else. Sure, you might think labor creates no wealth, but we at least run the place while owners profit the most. Can this be solved by some reform? No. They'll lobby against it. We've seen how far they'll go. And no, I'm not a Sovietist. Command economics are stupid and unviable. We need a cooperative economy with workers controlling their destinies. Take Mondragon Corporation for example. Seriously, we just need something new. We're killing our planet every second we maintain this system and now's the time to change. We can do it. We are all the same, impoverished people at the end of the day. So, my fellow shitlibs and cuckservatives, wake up and smell the pain. No more party nonsense. No more neoliberal culture wars. Unite and fight the capitalist goliath. Let us take individual freedom to the next level by creating a system that doesn't force us to slave away from 9-to-5 every day. And yes, keep your house. Just collectivize the factories and shit. Thank you, and I hope you walk away with your mind anew.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 5\n",
       "In the UK, our labour party has pledged to abolish our unelected upper house and replace it with an elected one. Currently, This house can slow down a bill but ultimately will always lose a fight with our elected upper house so really, it doesn't serve a purpose because it can't stop a bill dead I'm it's tracks.

       "The reddit adminsdemi-gods for some reason switched the sub to restricted posting -- thus preventing anyone from posting. But after 1 month the admins gave moderation of the sub to  so now we're back! Editadded Now that we have the sub operational again and a few users are here -- but here's what we need  I'll admit, I'm a geek and know little about marketing and don't really like marketing or sales. But we need to get the word out that this sub exists and to encourage people to check us out and use the sub. Care to help out with that task?!  We need more users, and specifically more users commenting on posts. With the advertising angle mentioned above, we should get more users. Then it's just a case of people using the sub more which will happen.  We need more people submitting posts -- but not too many posts. Too many posts and we lose track of posts with comments and discussions. I can post lots believe me! but I have a distinct point of view, preferences and like you I have my own biases. A variety of posters will create a more rounded sub-reddit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              4\n",

       "I have been watching Fox News today off and on. I just heard that they believe if Nancy Pelosi wasn't in charge they think the Democrates and Republicans could come to an agreement on how to fix the boarder issue with the illegal immigrants. So what I am wondering isn't there a way for the Representative of the House vote her out and set another Speaker? I mean correct me if I am wrong but they vote on whom is going to be Speaker depending what party has control right?

And believe me, it is a heated contest even in my inbox.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3\n",
       "It seems we have had a recent influx of refugees from , tired of the heavy-handed moderation there and their selective application of that sub's rules. Welcome! As a long-time Redditor I'll say there are some distinct differences between moderating a huge multi-million user sub like  and a smaller sub like  so I'll leave it at that. But here in  we're trying to evolve a different culture for the sub. Here we're small enough and the moderators' philosophy is such to let things be more open and free-wheeling. We do have a rule about using the real headline of an article and encourage people to give editorialized opinions not in the headline of posts, but in the comment sections. Besides, you can typically find articles with real headlines to give editorialized opinions in the titles of their articles if that's what you want. This no editorializing in headlines helps to encourage people to read the actual article too. I have a gripe and bias against ad hominem attacks and name calling, simply because that pushes a sub into becoming a rude sht-show of people screaming at each other. Instead of profanities and name calling, use your words to debate and understand! their point. The other thing about the culture of  that we try to encourage is not to downvote. Don't downvote posts just because you disagree with them! That's bad Reddiquette and it sets a negative toneculture for the sub this isn't . Try to downvote only for ad hominem attacks and clear-cut sht-posts whose aim is to insult, incite or cause a flame-war. The best way to handle twits who post is to deafen them with silence -- ignoring them will mean they'll go away. Feeding the twits and trolls causes them to stay and post more. Using those tactics will avoid  habits where any post supportive of Republicans or any post critical of Democrats -- no matter how valid and logical -- generates -20 or -170 worth of downvotes. You've probably seen that. It often brow-beats people into deleting their posts to stop the massive loss of karma. Edit Typos, clarity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               3\n",
       "Neither Biden nor Trump have done anything truly notable except further divide Americans. Trump claims correctly to have reached the lowest unemployment rate for African-Americans and Hispanics, but that's just because they had been steadily declining since the great recession. Biden was in part elected due to Trump having no plan for COVID, which Biden apparently had, but once in office he just called it a state issue, the exact same thing Trump did. x200B Neither of these guys have done anything that will matter in 5 years, the legislative body is what actually matters, and from what I've seen, most people don't even know their legislators or vote on them. x200B My point is, people that let who the president is determine which half of their fellow Americans they hate and dismiss as idiots are acting foolishly. This radicalization against one another is shallow. How can we as a nation expect to grow if we spend all our time dismantling the last 4 years of policy after every election?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3\n",

       "The thing that kinda gets me upset is how other states in the world constantly rail the US for not giving a large enough percentage of its GDP to foreign aid, United Nations projects and other things like that. Sure, the US is giving a smaller percentage than other industrialized first world nations, but the smaller percentage is still more than what other countries can collectively give. I don't have a problem that the US is sending aid in forms of money and resources abroad for certain things like disaster relief and to feed starving children in an impoverished country.

Off the top of my head I think it would be an at the least interesting idea but I just know there are downsides I'm not thinking of. Please don't downvote me just because you don't like that idea. I'm not American so I really don't know how this would negatively effect you, it's a serious question. I just know european countries are all small but just work together. Wouldn't the US benefit in ways to adopting that infrastructure?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",
       " All nations face face challenges to stay a float. Americas economic situation is only getting worst as the nations on the other side grow due to their cooperation with each other. America on the other hand only hurt relationships with its neighbors. As the United States of America. Their first priority should of been establishing good working and business relationships with countries in South America and kept good relationship with Canada which is part of North America. The thought of it being called north and South America yet no support from the United States of America just sounds crazy. America would rather bend over backwards for other nations on the other side of the world only because it puts them in good tactical positions which keeps America safe from certain threats. America failed to take care of its own side of the world. Where people are running from their country and passing other countries to go through hell just to get to America. America never thought to say hey whats going on over there . Let us help fix the issue. Due to the neglect of the countries around the United States.

       "when Trump said that Hezbollah was very smart, it was one of the extremely rare even a stopped clock is right twice a day moments. Donald J. Trump had it right, and we all know this because NO organization in the Levant, Israeli or Hamas or Hezbollah, reached their current level of political and military power by being anything but smart. Hezbollah as an organization has done horrible things, sure, but they aren't stupid or even merely passingly informed. They know what they're doing and they know how to go about doing it. You don't have to like them to accept their strengths in addition to knowing their weaknesses. So yeah, Trump this time had it right. Fuck him anyway, Donald J. Trump is a rapist. Questions?

       "He was always an independent thinker and has voted for Republicans and Democrats. Over the years he started listening to talk radio and since he retired watches a lot of Fox News. He now speaks the bullshit as his own thoughts, moving from the talking point of one week to the next, repeating what he is told to believe. I have lost a lot of respect for him as a result. I don't live in the same city as him so we talk so often and I see him a few times a year. Should I let it slide while debating the more egregiously stupid comments, or should I tell him that he has lost his ability to independently analyze information, come to his own opinions and that I have lost much respect for him as a result?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",
       " Republicans no longer care for bipartisanship and should be disbanded. They create false information regarding President Biden so they can inact revenge. I feel sorry for the few Republicans that do wish for bipartisanship because they will never get that from their radical colleuges. The United States government nearly avoided a collapse because these radicals wanted to cut government spending to zero. These Neo-Nazi Republicans want to shut the government down because of Trump's ridiculous and stupid demands. Any sane person understands that Trump is guilty of sedition. The other candidate, Ron DeSantis committed human rights violation while stationed at Guantomino Bay. Then you have that piece of shit Marjorie Taylor Greene who doesn't even know how to tie her shoes. Mitch McConnell is so old that nothing this piece of shit says makes since. Our government is no longer a Democracy. It is a Totalitarian Dictatorship ran by fascist Governor's who accept blood money from the NRA.

How is it anything other than absurd that Israel is the largest recipient of American foreign aid since WW2?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

       "Wikipedia, for one, labels the KKK as terrorists. makes sense to me. They're a radicalist organization That works on hatred of a certain group or groups of people, and intimidates and kills them. so they're clearly terrorists. But the Taliban aren't?

       "Right now, the three most powerful people in the GOP are arguably Matt Gaetz, Jim Jordan, and Donald Trump. Matt Gaetz toppled the former Speaker of the House. He is also someone who faces very credible allegations of repeatedly sexually exploiting minors. Jim Jordan is now a frontrunner to become the next Speaker. He continues to face very credible allegations of covering up sexual abuse at Ohio State. Donald Trump is the GOP's presidential frontrunner. His long list of felony allegations wouldn't fit on this screen, but they run the gamut of sexual, financial, and treasonous. This is today's GOP leadership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
       "RCV once commonly known under the moniker Instant Runoff VotingIRV is an indirect yet extremely potent tool in the voters' toolbox that can help return Speaker of the House to the House and not whichever political party controls the most levers. And no, I am not recommending RCV for the House members' voting on this issue. Sure, it could work and they can already do this, but that approach, on its own anyway, insists that you and I give up our power of the electorate. The power we as voters can wield will come from widespread use of Ranked Choice Voting so we are no longer left with a hard choice of one specific or another specific. RCV has been shown to reduce divisive campaigning and increase civility in political campaigns as well as offer a true wider range of choice. We like choice in our fast foods, and I'm willing to bet we'll love choice in our democratic processes. Think of the prospect of being able to vote for somebody who shares your values yet is committed to working with those of other thoughts in a peaceful and thoughtful manner. Think of a Speaker elected by a majority of our national Representatives and not by this or that political party. That is what could be achieved by you and I having access to RCV in the running of our governments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
       "You know what makes the u.s. and their gun laws so crazy? Apparently there was a shooting at unlv I just happened to catch them talking about it at beginning of golden knights game. I had no idea. Sounds like unless there are 10 or more killed it doesn't make news. Being in Canada this is just insane that this behaviour is accepted as fairly normal wothout anything ever changing. I was on Florida when parkland happened and I remember people saying how things must change but nothing ever does. In canada i dont know anyone who owns a hand gun or assault rifle, some people hunt coyotes or moose.

       "I have not been home for Christmas for a few years, the last I remember of her political views is when she was at an anti-Bush Rally in New York, she was adamantly anti-republican. Now she is friends with Glenn Beck on Facebook and watching his show and telling me that he speaks the truth After she was talking about it all day I realized I didn't have any ammo to argue with her, all i keep saying is he an idiot.

       "Disclaimer Not an American. A Canadian that is profoundly impacted by the business and economic outcomes of the events in the United States, and a friend to many of them, and thus follows your politics. I've watched the Republican Party tolerate some utterly unacceptable behaviour from some of their members. The amount of self-serving hypocrisy coming from the mouths of many prominent politicians often dominates on Reddit, and the complete lack of any sort of meaningful legislation that seems to be replaced in their plan by an intended agenda of revenge, distraction, and strong-arm positioning without even the thinnest of disguises, is terribly disheartening. I also was horrified to see the turnover of Roe versus Wade, and its implications to women's rights and overall future health in that country. It seemed that religious and power-hungry special interests, and a Supreme Court that has been compromised by at least one person that should be removed from the bench altogether for blatant and extraordinary conflicts of interest, are winning, and are quite likely to take home even greater limitations within the so-called country of the free. In the interests of brevity, let's just skip Donald Trump. At the heart of much of this sheer mess is the Republican party. It has allowed this collection of villains to manipulate its direction without policing them. Some of its most prominent members have worked with anti-American interests to increase their own power at the cost of the country's reputation and standing in the world, and it gives them a pass on this. Its main mouthpieces appear to be genuinely horrible people. And many outright criminals infest its ranks. And then there's the two people mentioned in the title. In all this vile wheelbarrow-full of outhouse diggings, two of its members placed themselves and their own political standing at profound risk to participate in the January 6th Select Committee. And their party ostracized them for trying to apply some form of actual justice in response to an intentionally engineered effort that resulted in the defilement of your capitol, a number of murders, a stunning international embarrassment to your country, and an attempted coup. I don't like Liz Cheney's other policies. But I can still admire the actions and the integrity of someone that I deeply disagree with. And although perhaps not for what they stand for in other ways, if only for their bipartisan actions on the committee, her and Adam Kinzinger deserve respect and thanks for demonstrating what the rest of the Republican party should strive to be.    1\n",

       "First up, some disclosures I'm not an American and I'm not living in America, also I'm a liberal. Now with that out of the way, from what I'm seeing, it seems that DeSantis and Trump more DeSantis right now, to be honest are trying to appeal to the far-right. Some of it is probably out of conviction again more for DeSantis, not sure how much conviction Trump actually has about political issues, but some is certainly to appeal to far-right voters to gain the nomination. Once one of them gets the nomination, I think it will be difficult for them to walk back their rhetoric towards the centre to appeal to a plurality of voters. I would love your views, both from Americans and from outsiders, on this opinion!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

Lets help people get lifted out of poverty into jobs, McCarthy said  Heres the thing, though Work requirements dont do that.  A mountain of studies have found that the significant work requirements already in place have little to no effect when it comes to growing employment numbers for welfare recipients. And a 2018 attempt to impose 80-hour-per-month work requirements for Medicaid recipients in Arkansas failed, and was halted by a judge less than a year after it began The program didnt increase employment levels, but it did kick 18,000 people off Medicaid.

       "As of right now, Trump looks like he is going to be the Republican nominee for POTUS in the 2024 election against Biden. There's a lot of doubt in the GOP about whether Trump is the best choice for the party for obvious reasons. I believe that many elected officials would really like to move on from Trump. Let's assume that Biden and Trump are chosen as the nominees. My questions is, what does the GOP and their electorate do if the 2024 election results in a big win for democrats executive, house, and senate which sends a message that a majority of the country is done with TrumpMAGA and that it may not be a winning movementstrategy moving forward. How do you think the electorate respond to this? How does Trump respond to it? How do surviving elected officials respond? Will the party move on from Trump? I am well aware that an election between Trump and Biden could result in a Trump victory, or that these two may not be the eventual nominees. Remember that this is just a hypothetical situation, please don't compare candidates or get too aggressive. Thank you!

BTW I'm genuinely trying to gain insight I'm not anti American just giving insight into the Ireland position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "EDIT To people in the us, it seems my question was understood only by a few. I am not asking why right-wingleaning people in the US do not support healthcare, I already know their reasons and that is fine, I am asking why the right-wing of the USA opposes healthcare when the right-wing in most other countries I know of do not oppose healthcare. I am asking why the US right is an outlier. Basically the title. For context, I'm pretty centre-left and live in Australia and we have two big parties, the more right-wing Liberal-National coalition, and the Labor party, the more left-wing party, and a bunch of smaller ones. Our healthcare was introduced by the left-wing party in the 70s and has pretty much just been added to since then. I do not support the liberal party but unlike the republicans they at least like medicare. The thing is, right-leaningright-wing people and the Liberal party are fine with healthcare. If you were to ask an average right-wing Australian about our medicare style healthcare, they would tell you it's a good thing that has benefited the country. As far as I know, they have not tried to remove it, and in fact, the right-wing party added subsidies for mental health care. It isn't perfect but it at least shows that even the right-wing party here supports medicare. Asking the same thing in the US, however, many people with right-wing beliefs would say that healthcare is terrible, along with most of the republican party? Why is this? Why do the right-wing people here have no issue with healthcare, but what has caused right-wing people in the US absolutely hate the idea of medicare style healthcare? How do right-wingright leaning people in other countries feel about healthcare, are they more like Australians or Americans?    140\n",
       "This may be overly simplistic, but I feel like in American politics many people and politicians have a fear of socialism, to the point that the terms socialism and socialist are used to disparage politicians that support more social programs. I feel like social programs can have some huge benefits, especially for the working and middle classes. I understand that communist regimes in the past and present have been associated with fascism, but socialism isn't necessarily fascism. So, is American fear of socialism misplaced fear of fascism?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          79\n",

       "I've been seeing a lot of posts about how Trump or Q-Anon's plan failed and how they all feel stupid right now. From reading a couple of posts it looks like the military was also supposed to get involved? If someone could explain what their plan was and why it failed and what Qanon even is? is it a man? a social media site? a movement? what is the white rabbit? I just have a lot of questions and could use some clarity.. thanks!!!

       "I've been scouring for sources to explain exactly what a republic is, though none can seem to decide or give one consistent answer. The best I can decipher is that a republic is a form of government where there is no one ruling person. Now, it's possible to be democratic and not republican the UK. Are there any examples of governments that are republic, yet not democratic?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
       "It seems that a lot of what Trump accomplishes is because congress allows it. McConnell allows it by not bringing things to the floor for a vote. If the Democrats keep the house and gain the majority in the senate, wouldn't that be as powerful? Even if a Democrat takes the presidency, if he can't do anything because McConnell can just block a vote on most anything the house and president try to do, how does that help? How many up for grabs seats are there in the senate this election cycle? Is there a good chance two seats can be flipped? How close is the house? Any chance of the Republicans retaking? I hear people saying that some of the candidates running for president would do better running for congress. I kind of agree with that. Especially if it means they could lose the seat they have. Take Beto for an example. Even if he were to win the nomination. I would think the country would be better off with the next best Democratic candidate and Beto beating Cornyn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

       "I'll go first, guns shouldn't be a constitutional right. I'm not saying I want a unarmed society, guns serve as valuable tools and I'll admit shooting is fun. We can have that without them being a right, there's gun ownership in countries around the world and America is pretty unique in protecting and enshrining that as a right.  They don't make us more free, having them enshrined as a right. Here is a freedom and rights index and we're ranked below many states where they don't have that as a right. Once you've proven yourself responsible by passing a background check and passing a simple safety test as well as purchasing a safe storage space then I believe you should be granted the privilege to own a gun.

If we look at previous socialist experiments like Maoist China 1949-1978 or the Soviet Union 1917-1956, we can see socialism working significantly well. Workers had healthcare, housing, education, as well as, to some degree, a direct participatory role in organizing and control of their own society and institutions. This isnt to say Maoist China or the Soviet Union were perfect societies, but compared to capitalism where people have to go into debt to receive these things, or not even have them at all, as well as workers having little to no say or control at the workplacehow does one maintain a belief in capitalism when its been shown to fail at the most basic things that socialism was able to accomplish to a great extent?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          73\n",
       "January 6th is the day that the electoral college votes are counted after an election. It is essentially the formal ending of the election, which certifies the results and essentially formalizes them. Its a symbolic and ceremonial day, in a sense, but also important, as it cements the result as legitimate. Its part of the peaceful transfer or continuation of power. Trump had been plotting for months to have Pence disrupt this centuries old process, to have votes that werent for him thrown out and to deny the votes of 7 states, since they werent in his favor, see  Ive seen Trump supporters argue, but he told his supporters to be peaceful in the speech, okay, but what was the rest of the speech about then? Why was he there? Even if, lets be generous, he didnt literally mean fight like hell and was using it as a metaphor, what was he talking about in his speech there? What intention did he have by inciting his supporters to March to the Capitol? I dont consider the actual events of January 6th to be an insurrection. I feel like it distracts from the more important issue I consider the insurrection to be Trumps willful slandering of the new President, the denial of the election result. His very presence there on January 6th and his urging his supporters to interrupt and still the democratic process - whether violently or not - is the insurrection. Read the linked Eastman memos. They demonstrate an organized plan of insurrection. This was a premeditated plot to steal the election by denial of the votes of millions of people in 7 separate states. So, how do Trump supporters defend against this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          69\n",

       "Generative AI will create a 'tsunami of disinformation' during the 2024 election A.I. Propaganda means people will have to learn how to research better!!! invest in reading and comprehension, and embrace critical thinking, and overcome short attention span mentality of seeking to avoid thinking. Avoid selective amnesia, and be careful with drama based inciting headlines and commentary, and focus on actual facts. The less work we put in, the more gullible we make ourselves, and we then only have ourselves to blame, as being an uninformed and unknowledgeable voter. First LEARN THE PREAMBLE, and take time to understand it. We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish Justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America. Know the meaning of why The Preamble exist It is not law, it is about principles and values, goals, responsibility, duty and objectives of a representative democracy. The Preamble, tells what the Reason, Purpose, Duty, Responsibilities and Goals are to facilitate the Principle, the Values and the Objectives, of Our Representative Democracy. Take time to understand, The Articles of The Constitution were designed to create a governing system capable and able to implement, create, promote, support and advance this nation. It tells how congress is create, and the responsibility of the House of Representative, and the responsibility of the Senate. The processes of congress responsibility to create, craft and facilitate legislation and confirm legislation to honor and respect the principles, uphold the values and achieve the objectives and maintain the values of our representative democracy. We are a Republic Form of Representative Government, which means we elect people to represent us. Second READ 1. Read the Federal Register' to get actual information on Legislative Bills and Measures. 2. Read The House of Representative Bills to get actual information about what is within a Bill. 3 Read Bills and Resolutions in Congress 4 Read Know what your party's platform is and what its objectives are. 5 Research Candidates Read and learn what their personal motivation is, and what are their personal objectives, and how do they expect to deal with personal ideals and the ideals of the people, and make sure their personal ideals are congruent with the ideals of the Preamble, and of the citizen populations respect of the principles and values of The Preamble. Schools do not teach this, it is the responsibility of people to learn it, to be responsible voters. That's why a representative democracy is best served by an educated and knowledgeable citizen population of what a representative democracy is, and how it functions.  Know what American Governmental Politics is It is not about culture wars, it is not about competing religions, it is not about racial divisions, it is not about political party's Political Parties are nothing more than lobbyist organizational programs When we understand these principle factors... We, as an individual, become less prone to lose ourselves in drama antics advertisement, drama promoted narratives, drama created fear and scare tactics, hysteria promoting conspiracies' and we will be able to not be misled by advertisement, where they are created by A.I. or people intent to deflection, denialism promotions, scare games, and other manipulative control tactics.      4\n",

If you care about the lives of your fellow Americans you should support gun control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              4\n",
       "If you are voting for the lesser of two evils, you are voting for evil. Not just because you are literally voting for evil, but also because you are voting against the democratic system. Strategic voting is a gamifies the democratic process. Whether you're against Biden or against Trump, by excluding third party candidates so the guy you don't like doesn't get in you are reinforcing a system that collapses down into having two really shitty candidates that no one believes they have the option to not vote for. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. If everyone rejected that philosophy, it wouldn't happen, then instead of having two shitty candidates, we could actually have a selection of good ones. If you value democracy, don't play the game of strategic voting. Vote for an alternate party that aligns best with your views.

       "So obviously their are so many choices to pick from, and im not sure where i fall under in my beliefs.\\r \\r So i wasam an anarchist, but not your traditional anarchist of no governmentno rules. at least how the earth is right, now the way the world has been shaped through past influences obviously shapes the personality and psychology of people today for the negative IMO from capitalism, and the dog eat dog style. and there are just far too many people to be able to effectively run a cohesive society.\\r \\r so the way i look at it we need some form of governmentsystem that their job is to provide the ability for people to be able to actually reform into a world where we actually take care of each other and the well being is the 1 goal instead of capitalism, domination, and power, especially now with the advancement of technology to the point where we have the ability to do pretty much anything, we could eradicate world hunger, have fresh water, greatly reduce pollutionenvironmental problems, mental health and addiction, but the world is so fucked up from the past that it seems impossible right now.\\r \\r So i believe once we reach a world of balance we wont need a dominating form of government especially on a nationalinternational level, but we would be able to break it down to smaller community systems of taking care of ourselves and our immediate surroundings and being able to work with everyone else to be able to get what we wantneed.\\r \\r i think people look at politics from the lens of the past of what worked then and it should work now, but those were different times with different psychologies from the environments they were a part of, and what worked in one place mightprobably wont work else where.\\r \\r So i usually call my self a Anarcho-socialist, but im just not sure...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",

       "It is my perspective that politicians prefer sponsoring new projects that get their name on a bridge or give them enough fame for reelection rather than continued support of an existing system. Its anecdotal evidence but I see social programs and infrastructure slowly deteriorate from lack of funding, bloat, or suffer from bad administration until it gets so bad that it suddenly requires a large influx of political will and money. I have also noticed politicians making short-term decisions that have large repercussions down the line that they don't need to face once they're out of office. Such as accepting a large loan for infrastructure that will need to be paid back or selling public infrastructure and leasing it back for a large windfall of cash. What measures could be put in place to ensure non-sexy projects are kept funded and politicians in office for a short amount of time can't harm the public in the long run?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
