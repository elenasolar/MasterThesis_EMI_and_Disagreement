       "Conservatives fear government control of just about anything. They're raised to believe the government (Federal) doesn't work and we would waste money. There's also the fact that many Americans do not want the Government to have their health information; which I can understand. Ultimately I don't think the government needs our health records to improve healthcare costs.\\n\\nIn reality, every comparison I've seen shows countries with Universal Healthcare pay about the same per month as Americans, but then Americans have a co-pay after they've paid for 3x the cost of care in premiums already. This is what people conveniently gloss over in many arguments against. You pay for healthcare each month, only to pay for it again when you have to use it.\\n\\nPeople don't understand how much their \"great\" insurance through private companies is just inflated costs to increase their margin and deter people from paying out of pocket.\\n\\n[https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0093](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0093)\\n\\nThere's literally inflation built in at every step to make private insurance companies more money. Your non-insured rate will be artificially inflated to be higher than the cost your insurance pays so that you will use insurance. The actual cost of care for many procedures is inflated by anywhere from 200-400%; and even higher in some rare instances.\\n\\nMedicare has a rules that all procedures must be medically necessary and have a strict process of cost limits and coding procedures required before the hospital can request payment. I worked for a company that processed healthcare claims for 1000's of hospitals for about 7 years. Medicare is SUPER strict about what it accepts, which is why I laughed at all the conspiracy theories about hospitals marking patients as COVID infected to make more money. There's very little chance you can fake this in any kind of scale without a pattern emerging and the paper trail is typically damning. FYI, if Medicare denies payment, the hospital now has to try to collect it in full from the patient. This costs extra time and money for the Hospital to get paid and often results in reduced pricing or payment plans that people can never realistically pay off.\\n\\nThere's also the issue of variance in cost between hospitals. some charge 4x as much for the same procedure using the same equipment. Medicare doesn't allow this as they set reasonable cost of procedures by region and many other factors. This ensures that people covered by Medicare can go to any place that accepts their coverage and pay roughly the same price.\\n\\nI think the best first step is for the Government to dictate across the country what the average cost of a procedure is by region and the Federal Government mandate that hospitals cannot charge more than this amount (within 10%). This cost applies to allowable insurance rates or self-pay as well. if you have cash to pay for treatment you should not have to pay more than if you had health insurance. Allowing consumers to pay the same price on or off insurance seems like common sense, but this is a capitalist country through and through and greed is certainly in play here.\\n\\nIn the end, I think this is what Joe Biden is trying to offer by opening up Medicare to include a public offering. People who want to pay Medicare's rates have that option over private insurance.\\n\\n[https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/how-much-more-than-medicare-do-private-insurers-pay-a-review-of-the-literature/#:\\~:text=Based%20on%20the%20reviewed%20studies,inpatient%20hospital%20services%2C%20264%25%20of](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/how-much-more-than-medicare-do-private-insurers-pay-a-review-of-the-literature/#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20reviewed%20studies,inpatient%20hospital%20services%2C%20264%25%20of)\\n\\n&gt;Based on the reviewed studies comparing Medicare and private insurance rates for hospital and physician services, this brief finds that private insurance payments are consistently greater, averaging 199% of Medicare rates for hospital services overall, 189% of Medicare rates for inpatient hospital services, 264% of Medicare rates for outpatient hospital services, and 143% of Medicare rates for physician services. However, there is wide variation across studies due to different market dynamics in different parts of the country and for different types of medical care as well as differences in the studies’ methodology and data sources. Private payment rates for hospitals averaged as high as 358% of Medicare rates in a study of a highly concentrated state-level hospital market, and as low as 151% of Medicare rates in a study of a market with one dominant private insurer, with individual studies demonstrating even greater variation across markets, services, and individual hospitals.\\n\\nAt best private insurance is 1.5x as expensive as Medicare coverage. At worst, 3.6x more expensive. Keep in mind that location and the type of procedure greatly impact the cost of treatment. Making the cost of care equal given adjustment for regional cost factors, overall healthcare costs can likely be cut in half for the actual patient/consumer.\\n\\nEDIT: tldr: Insurance companies artificially inflate rates for covered and non-covered care to make more money. Using Medicare's method of standardizing the cost of care by location/region can drastically reduce the cost to patients without allowing the Government access to our Protected Health Information (PHI).\\n\\nEDIT2: Joe Biden did not advocate Medicare-for-all. In fact he said he would outright Veto any proposals like this. Joe Biden is going to offer a Public Medicare option which people can use if they cannot qualify for Medicaid and their Employer-offered insurance is too expensive.     105\n",

       "As of right now, his chances of winning the Democratic nomination appear to be slim to nil.\\n\\n[60 to 70% of Democrats](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html) prefer Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Bernie Sanders is running between about 50 and 65 points behind her, and is consistently outperformed by both Elizabeth Warren (who has repeatedly and emphatically stated that she is not running) and Joe Biden. [In a CBS/NYT poll released May 5](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-the-2016-presidential-race/), only 23% of Democrats said they would consider voting for Sanders, while only 7% said they would *not* consider voting for Hillary. (Keep in mind that these polls were taken *after* the email and Clinton Foundation scandals broke, in light of which she has proved [remarkably durable](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_presidential_race.html).)\\n\\nI frequently see Sanders compared electorally to Obama on Reddit. But [at this point in 2007](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html), Clinton was only at 36% and Obama was at 23%. In the preceding four months, Obama had increased his share by close to 10 percentage points; Sanders, by contrast, has barely budged. Furthermore, at no point during the 2008 primary season was Obama ever more than about 25 percentage points behind Clinton. Sanders' standing now is not comparable to Obama's standing then, nor is Clinton's sheer numerical superiority now comparable to her nebulous \"air of inevitability\" then. [FiveThirtyEight's analysis](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-hillary-clinton-steamroller-rumbles-to-life/) is that she's the most dominant primary frontrunner we've ever seen.\\n\\nI've been a fan of Sanders since back when he was in the House,  but I do not see a path to the Democratic nomination for him in 2016. The numbers just don't add up.
