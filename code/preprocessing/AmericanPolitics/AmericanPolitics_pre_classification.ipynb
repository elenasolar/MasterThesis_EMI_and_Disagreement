       "He was always an independent thinker and has voted for Republicans and Democrats. Over the years he started listening to talk radio and since he retired watches a lot of Fox News. He now speaks the bullshit as his own thoughts, moving from the talking point of one week to the next, repeating what he is told to believe.\\n\\nI have lost a lot of respect for him as a result. I don't live in the same city as him so we talk so often and I see him a few times a year.

       "I follow the news through Twitter (X, or whatever we have to call it now), and most of the news on my page is US-based, which makes sense, it being (still, and for now, unless Musk sells it to Russia or something) a US app.\\n\\nEven factoring in the blue checks, who mainly exist just to troll, it still strikes me that Americans in general seem to get *extraordinarily* angry and aggressive over political matters. It's rare to find a political thread without a \"GTFO\", or a middle finger salute emoji, an allusion to the intelligence of the other person, a derisive comment about the source of their argument, and on it goes.\\n\\nHowever, I could be falling victim to the assumption that the discourse on Twitter is representative of how Americans talk about politics in real life, when that may in fact not be the case.\\n\\nSo my basic question is, how representative is Twitter of the general nature of political discourse in the USA? Is it possible to talk politics without it becoming a battle of insults?\\n\\n(I'm from the UK, if it matters).\\n\\n&#x200B;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

       "According to Politico, a total of 101 cases of damage to power grids caused by intentional attacks reported to the U.S. Department of Energy by power companies between January and August of this year were counted. This is an increase of more than 70% compared to the same period last year. Politico said, “It is an increase in power grid attacks that has not been seen for at least 10 years.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
       "^(Disclaimer: Not an American. A Canadian that is profoundly impacted by the business and economic outcomes of the events in the United States, and a friend to many of them, and thus follows your politics.)\\n\\nI've watched the Republican Party tolerate some utterly unacceptable behaviour from some of their members. The amount of self-serving hypocrisy coming from the mouths of many prominent politicians often dominates on Reddit, and the complete lack of any sort of meaningful legislation that seems to be replaced in their plan by an intended agenda of revenge, distraction, and strong-arm positioning without even the thinnest of disguises, is terribly disheartening.\\n\\nI also was horrified to see the turnover of Roe versus Wade, and its implications to women's rights and overall future health in that country. It seemed that religious and power-hungry special interests, and a Supreme Court that has been compromised by at least one person that should be removed from the bench altogether for blatant and extraordinary conflicts of interest, are winning, and are quite likely to take home even greater limitations within the so-called \"country of the free\".\\n\\nIn the interests of brevity, let's just skip Donald Trump.\\n\\nAt the heart of much of this sheer mess is the Republican party.\\n\\nIt has allowed this collection of villains to manipulate its direction without policing them. Some of its most prominent members have worked with anti-American interests to increase their own power at the cost of the country's reputation and standing in the world, and it gives them a pass on this. Its main mouthpieces appear to be genuinely horrible people. And many outright criminals infest its ranks.\\n\\nAnd then there's the two people mentioned in the title. In all this vile wheelbarrow-full of outhouse diggings, two of its members placed themselves and their own political standing at profound risk to participate in the January 6th Select Committee. And their party ostracized them for trying to apply some form of actual justice in response to an intentionally engineered effort that resulted in the defilement of your capitol, a number of murders, a stunning international embarrassment to your country, and an attempted coup.\\n\\nI don't like Liz Cheney's other policies. But I can still admire the actions and the integrity of someone that I deeply disagree with.  And although perhaps not for what they stand for in other ways, if only for their bipartisan actions on the committee, her and Adam Kinzinger deserve respect and thanks for demonstrating what the rest of the Republican party should strive to be.    1\n",

       "\\r  \\nLet's unpack the curious case of the MAGA movement and its, shall we say, intense dedication to the Donald. [Remember those Christmas Day Truth Social rants in all caps](https://www.nationalmemo.com/trump-cult-2666808490)? Yeah, not exactly carols by the fireplace.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBut why the unwavering loyalty to a guy who seems like the human embodiment of the Seven Deadly Sins (greed, lust, you name it) for millions of Republican evangelicals? Buckle up, because it's a wild ride.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nTurns out, the MAGA magic has less to do with religion and more to do with good ol' fashioned fanaticism. Think of it like sports team loyalty on steroids, mixed with a healthy dose of \"us vs. them\" mentality. These folks see Trump as their champion, the fighter against the evil \"JOE BIDEN'S MISFITS & THUGS,\" whoever they may be.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSome might call it blind faith, but there's actually some psychological science behind it. Experts say fundamentalist groups (religious or political) thrive on three things: certainty, ferocity, and solidarity. They believe they're right, everyone else is wrong, and anyone who disagrees is basically the devil incarnate. Sound familiar?\\r  \\n\\r  \\nNow, picture George Orwell analyzing Trump like a political luchador. He'd probably say something like, \"This guy gets it. People don't just want Netflix and chill, they crave struggle, danger, and maybe a few flags and parades thrown in for good measure.\" And wouldn't you know it, that's exactly what Trump delivers. He's the ultimate crybaby conqueror, whining about persecution while whipping his supporters into a frenzy.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBut where does this all lead? History tells us fundamentalist cults rarely end well. Sometimes it's a fiery implosion, sometimes it's a slow fizzle. Only time will tell which way the MAGA movement goes, but one thing's for sure: it's gonna be a bumpy ride.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSo, Reddit, what do you think? Does Trump tap into some deep-seated human need for struggle and certainty? Or is it just a whole lot of hot air and hairspray holding it all together?
