h51hsd5,h5a61n6,"Both of our ruling parties are right-of-center capitalist parties funded by competing groups of rich people. They stay in power because they've rigged the electoral system to prevent so-called third parties from competing. This is done in many ways. A few examples  Elections are made as expensive as possible in all ways. This keeps the rich in control.  Ballot access is restricted and made expensive. Just to get on the ballot not only costs big money, but the number of signatures and the timeframe to get those signatures and the costs to verify them are in a short window thus requiring large numbers of typically paid people.  Media access is restricted and is wildly costly. We have a noble equal access law to access the public airways, but Republican and Democrat judges have interpreted that law to only apply to the Democrat and Republican parties. This goes even to the national TV presidential debates. After Ross Perot appeared as a 3rd party candidate in the 1992 debate and got 19 of the vote, the Republican and Democrats closed the debates and made them private. Now even if a 3rd party candidate is on the ballot in all 50 states, the candidate is arrested and hauled away in handcuffs if they try to show up at the debate.  The 5 corporation that control our mass media all collude to not report on 3rd parties. They are not featured on TV and after an election their vote tallies are not announced -- only the Republican and Democrat parties are reported. 3rd parties typically have to wait a week or more just to find our how many people voted for them.

The House is responsible for the national budget while the Senate handles things like judicial nominations. There's some overlap, but the Senate is in my opinion the more powerful of the two legislative bodies because the Senate must ratify any budget the House puts forward but the House has no say on any judicial ratification. Senate Republicans have been abusing Senate rules on holds and filibuster for almost twenty years, creating roadblocks requiring a two-thirds majority vote in order to bypass on any major piece of legislation Democrats try to pass. During her tenure as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi oversaw the passage of a lot of very progressive legislation that went on to die in the Senate. There is a fix for it, but conservative Democrats like Manchin and Sinema have stood in the way of implementing them because they don't want progressive legislation either.

The only similarity with the Senate is that new Upper House is to be elected, not appointed, and perhaps also its composition, which could be based on fixed regional representation this is however not spelled out in the Report and instead reserved for future discussions. The best I can grasp what they propose, the main purpose of new House, which will replace the Lords and will inherit some, but not all, of its current functions, is to protect new distribution of powers between Westminster, local councils and devolved parliaments. It'll also be 4 times smaller 200 vs current 800 and elected, but on a different schedule from Commons. So in a way, new House, Assembly of the Nations and Regions, will be even less powerful than Lords, at least as far as regular day-to-day legislation is concerned. In my opinion, this is incompatible with being elected you either have an appointed advisory panel or elected body with real powers, can't combine the two but it would appear this is precisely what Labour intends to do. U.S. Senate does, of course, traces some of its history and heritage to Lords as it existed in the 18th century. First and most importantly, Senators were appointed, not elected, until 17th amendment was ratified in 1913. It would appear Framers intended it to be a body which balances the lower house and advises the Executive, not blocks each and every law based on its party composition, which is what we have today.",knign,,2,,2022-12-06 18:21:48,"In the UK, our labour party has pledged to abolish our unelected upper house and replace it with an elected one.

A Canadian that is profoundly impacted by the business and economic outcomes of the events in the United States, and a friend to many of them, and thus follows your politics. I've watched the Republican Party tolerate some utterly unacceptable behaviour from some of their members. The amount of self-serving hypocrisy coming from the mouths of many prominent politicians often dominates on Reddit, and the complete lack of any sort of meaningful legislation that seems to be replaced in their plan by an intended agenda of revenge, distraction, and strong-arm positioning without even the thinnest of disguises, is terribly disheartening. I also was horrified to see the turnover of Roe versus Wade, and its implications to women's rights and overall future health in that country. It seemed that religious and power-hungry special interests, and a Supreme Court that has been compromised by at least one person that should be removed from the bench altogether for blatant and extraordinary conflicts of interest, are winning, and are quite likely to take home even greater limitations within the so-called country of the free. In the interests of brevity, let's just skip Donald Trump. At the heart of much of this sheer mess is the Republican party. It has allowed this collection of villains to manipulate its direction without policing them. Some of its most prominent members have worked with anti-American interests to increase their own power at the cost of the country's reputation and standing in the world, and it gives them a pass on this. Its main mouthpieces appear to be genuinely horrible people. And many outright criminals infest its ranks. And then there's the two people mentioned in the title. In all this vile wheelbarrow-full of outhouse diggings, two of its members placed themselves and their own political standing at profound risk to participate in the January 6th Select Committee. And their party ostracized them for trying to apply some form of actual justice in response to an intentionally engineered effort that resulted in the defilement of your capitol, a number of murders, a stunning international embarrassment to your country, and an attempted coup.

Surely the best way to stop the violence, if you want to keep guns legal, is tight restrictions and psychological tests repeatedly to determine someone's sanity and ensure they won't shoot up a bunch of children. 5 People still blame the person but a sane person is more in control than an insane person so is more liable for their actions than the insane person, so guns should then be restricted, right?

Apparently there was a shooting at unlv I just happened to catch them talking about it at beginning of golden knights game. I had no idea.
